## 6(iv) Aids to Health: Immunity and Medical Interventions

### Types of Immunity

#### Active Immunity
Immunity developed by the body's own immune system in response to antigens.

**Natural Active Immunity:**
- Acquired after recovering from a disease
- Long-lasting protection
- Example: Immunity after chickenpox

**Artificial Active Immunity:**
- Acquired through vaccination
- Vaccines contain weakened or killed pathogens
- Example: Polio vaccine, MMR vaccine

#### Passive Immunity
Immunity acquired from external sources without the body producing its own antibodies.

**Natural Passive Immunity:**
- Antibodies transferred from mother to baby through placenta or breast milk
- Temporary protection
- Example: Newborn immunity to measles

**Artificial Passive Immunity:**
- Injection of ready-made antibodies (antiserum)
- Immediate but short-term protection
- Example: Anti-snake venom

### Medical Interventions

#### Vaccination

- **Mechanism:** Introduction of weakened/killed pathogens or their components
- **Examples:** BCG (tuberculosis), DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus), MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)
- **Benefits:** Prevention of diseases, community immunity (herd immunity)

#### Immunization
- **Definition:** Process of making a person immune to disease
- **Methods:** Vaccination, natural infection recovery
- **Importance:** Disease prevention, epidemic control

#### Antitoxin
- **Purpose:** Neutralize specific toxins produced by bacteria
- **Source:** Antibodies from immunized animals or humans
- **Examples:** Diphtheria antitoxin, tetanus antitoxin
- **Action:** Immediate neutralization of toxins

#### Serum
- **Definition:** Blood plasma containing antibodies
- **Types:** Antiserum (specific antibodies), convalescent serum
- **Uses:** Treatment of infectious diseases, passive immunization
- **Examples:** Anti-snake bite serum, anti-rabies serum

#### Antiseptics
- **Purpose:** Prevent infection by inhibiting growth of microorganisms
- **Use:** Applied to living tissues (skin, wounds)
- **Examples:** Iodine, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, Dettol
- **Action:** Bacteriostatic or bactericidal on living tissues

#### Disinfectants
- **Purpose:** Kill or inactivate microorganisms
- **Use:** Applied to non-living surfaces and objects
- **Examples:** Bleach, phenol, formalin, UV radiation
- **Action:** Destruction of pathogens on inanimate objects

#### Antibiotics
- **Purpose:** Treat bacterial infections
- **Mechanism:** Kill bacteria or inhibit their growth
- **Examples:** Penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin
- **Important Notes:** 
  - Effective only against bacteria, not viruses
  - Must complete prescribed course
  - Overuse leads to antibiotic resistance

### Local Defense System

#### Components and Functions
- **Skin:** First barrier against pathogens
- **Mucous membranes:** Trap and expel foreign particles
- **Stomach acid:** Kills ingested bacteria
- **White blood cells:** Identify and destroy invaders
- **Inflammatory response:** Localizes infection and promotes healing

#### Merits of Local Defense System
- **Immediate response:** Provides instant protection
- **Non-specific protection:** Works against various pathogens
- **Memory function:** Recognizes previously encountered pathogens
- **Cost-effective:** Body's natural defense mechanism
- **Adaptable:** Responds to new and changing threats

### Difference Between Antiseptics and Disinfectants

| Aspect | Antiseptics | Disinfectants |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Application** | Living tissues | Non-living surfaces |
| **Concentration** | Lower (gentler) | Higher (stronger) |
| **Toxicity** | Less toxic to cells | More toxic |
| **Examples** | Iodine, Dettol | Bleach, phenol |
| **Purpose** | Prevent infection | Kill microorganisms |
| **Use on humans** | Safe for external use | Not safe for living tissue |
