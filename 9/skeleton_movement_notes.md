# Skeleton - Movement and Locomotion - Detailed Study Notes

## Functions of Human Skeleton

The human skeleton serves multiple vital functions that are essential for survival and daily activities.

### 1. Support and Framework
- **Structural Support:** Provides rigid framework that maintains body shape and posture
- **Body Architecture:** Acts as scaffolding for attachment of muscles, organs, and tissues
- **Weight Distribution:** Distributes body weight evenly to prevent collapse
- **Examples:** Vertebral column supports upper body weight, leg bones support entire body weight

### 2. Protection of Internal Organs
- **Cranium:** Protects brain from physical damage
- **Rib Cage:** Shields heart, lungs, and major blood vessels
- **Vertebral Column:** Protects spinal cord
- **Pelvic Girdle:** Protects reproductive organs, bladder, and lower digestive organs
- **Importance:** Prevents damage from external impacts and mechanical stress

### 3. Movement and Locomotion
- **Muscle Attachment:** Provides anchor points for skeletal muscles
- **Lever System:** Bones act as levers, joints as fulcrums, muscles provide force
- **Locomotion:** Enables walking, running, jumping, and all forms of movement
- **Fine Motor Skills:** Allows precise movements like writing, typing, grasping

### 4. Blood Cell Production (Hematopoiesis)
- **Red Bone Marrow:** Produces red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
- **Location:** Found in flat bones (sternum, ribs, hip bones) and ends of long bones
- **Continuous Process:** Replaces old blood cells throughout life
- **Importance:** Maintains oxygen transport, immune function, and blood clotting

### 5. Mineral Storage and Homeostasis
- **Calcium Storage:** 99% of body's calcium stored in bones
- **Phosphorus Storage:** Major reservoir of phosphate ions
- **Mineral Release:** Releases minerals into bloodstream when needed
- **pH Balance:** Helps maintain acid-base balance in blood
- **Bone Remodeling:** Constant breakdown and rebuilding maintains mineral homeostasis

### 6. Fat Storage
- **Yellow Bone Marrow:** Stores fat (adipose tissue) in medullary cavities
- **Energy Reserve:** Provides energy during times of nutritional stress
- **Location:** Primarily in long bones of arms and legs in adults
