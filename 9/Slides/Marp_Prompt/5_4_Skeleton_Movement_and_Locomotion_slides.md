# Skeleton: Movement & Locomotion

## A Comprehensive Guide

---

## 1. Functions of the Human Skeleton

*   **Support:** Forms rigid framework, maintains shape/posture.
*   **Protection:** Shields internal organs (skull protects brain, rib cage protects heart/lungs).
*   **Movement:** Bones act as levers, joints as fulcrums. Muscles pull on bones.
*   **Mineral Storage:** Reservoir for calcium and phosphorus.
*   **Blood Cell Production (Hematopoiesis):** Red bone marrow produces blood cells.
*   **Fat Storage:** Yellow bone marrow stores fat.

## 2. Axial and Appendicular Skeleton

### 2.1 Axial Skeleton

*   **Definition:** Forms central axis of the body (head, neck, trunk).
*   **Components (80 bones):**
    *   **Skull:** Cranial and facial bones.
    *   **Auditory Ossicles:** Inner ear bones.
    *   **Hyoid Bone:** Supports tongue.
    *   **Vertebral Column (Spine):** 33 vertebrae.
    *   **Thoracic Cage:** Sternum and 12 pairs of ribs.
*   **Functions:** Protects vital organs, supports posture.

---

### 2.2 Appendicular Skeleton

*   **Definition:** Comprises the bones of the limbs (appendages) and the girdles that attach them to the axial skeleton.
*   **Components (126 bones):**
    *   **Pectoral (Shoulder) Girdle:** Clavicle, scapula.
    *   **Upper Limbs:** Humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges.
    *   **Pelvic (Hip) Girdle:** Two coxal bones.
    *   **Lower Limbs:** Femur, patella, tibia, fibula, tarsals, metatarsals, phalanges.
*   **Functions:** Movement, locomotion, manipulation of objects.

## 3. Types of Joints

*   Points where two or more bones meet.
*   Classified by movement or material connecting bones.

---

### 3.1 Classification by Movement (Functional Classification)

*   **Immovable Joints (Synarthroses):** No movement.
    *   **Example:** Sutures of the skull.
*   **Slightly Movable Joints (Amphiarthroses):** Limited movement.
    *   **Examples:** Vertebral joints (intervertebral discs), pubic symphysis.
*   **Freely Movable Joints (Diarthroses / Synovial Joints):** Wide range of motion, synovial fluid.

---

#### Types of Freely Movable (Synovial) Joints

*   **Hinge Joint:** Movement in one plane (flexion/extension).
    *   **Examples:** Elbow, knee, finger/toe joints.
*   **Ball and Socket Joint:** Greatest range of motion (all directions).
    *   **Examples:** Shoulder, hip.
*   **Pivot Joint:** Rotational movement around central axis.
    *   **Examples:** Atlantoaxial joint (head rotation), radioulnar joint.
*   **Gliding (Plane) Joint:** Flat, sliding movements.
    *   **Examples:** Carpals of wrist, tarsals of ankle.
*   **Condyloid (Ellipsoid) Joint:** Movement in two planes (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction), no axial rotation.
    *   **Examples:** Radiocarpal (wrist), metacarpophalangeal (knuckles).
*   **Saddle Joint:** Back-and-forth and side-to-side movements, limited rotation.
    *   **Example:** Carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.

### 3.2 Classification by Structure (Brief Overview)

*   **Fibrous Joints:** Bones joined by dense fibrous connective tissue (e.g., skull sutures).
*   **Cartilaginous Joints:** Bones united by cartilage (e.g., pubic symphysis, intervertebral discs).
*   **Synovial Joints:** Bones separated by fluid-filled joint cavity (all freely movable joints).
