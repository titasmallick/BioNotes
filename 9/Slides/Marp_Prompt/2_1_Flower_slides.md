# The Flower: A Marvel of Reproduction

## Introduction: What is a Flower?

*   Reproductive unit of an angiosperm (flowering plant).
*   Modified shoot with condensed internodes, modified leaves.
*   Primary purpose: Produce seeds through sexual reproduction.

---

## Structure of a Bisexual Flower

*   Contains both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) parts.
*   Arranged in four concentric **whorls** on the receptacle.
*   **Four whorls:** Calyx, Corolla, Androecium, Gynoecium.

---

### Complete vs. Incomplete Flowers

*   **Complete Flower:** Possesses all four whorls (calyx, corolla, androecium, gynoecium).
    *   **Example:** Hibiscus, Rose, Pea.
*   **Incomplete Flower:** Missing one or more of the four whorls.
    *   **Example:** Begonia, Mulberry, Date Palm.

## The Whorls of a Flower: Parts and Functions

### 1. Non-Essential (Accessory) Whorls

*   Do not directly participate in reproduction.
*   Protect reproductive parts, attract pollinators.

---

| Whorl | Individual Unit | Description & Structure | Function(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calyx** | **Sepal** | Outermost, typically green, leaf-like. Encloses bud. | **Protection:** Guards inner whorls. <br> **Photosynthesis:** If green. |
| **Corolla** | **Petal** | Inside calyx. Petals are often large, brightly colored, and scented. | **Attraction:** Attracts pollinators. |

*   **Perianth:** Undifferentiated calyx and corolla (e.g., lily). Individual units: **tepals**.

---

### 2. Essential (Reproductive) Whorls

*   Directly involved in reproduction (gamete/seed production).

---

| Whorl | Part | Description & Structure | Function(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Androecium** | **Stamen** | Male reproductive part. <br> **Anther:** Bilobed sac. <br> **Filament:** Stalk. | **Anther:** Produces/stores **pollen grains** (male gametes). <br> **Filament:** Supports anther. |
| **Gynoecium (Pistil)** | **Carpel** | Female reproductive part. <br> **Stigma:** Receptive tip. <br> **Style:** Tube connecting stigma to ovary. <br> **Ovary:** Swollen basal part, contains **ovules**. | **Stigma:** Landing platform for pollen. <br> **Style:** Pathway for pollen tube. <br> **Ovary:** Protects ovules. Develops into **fruit**; ovules into **seeds**. |

## Inflorescence: The Arrangement of Flowers

*   Arrangement of a cluster of flowers on a floral axis (peduncle).

---

### Main Types of Inflorescence

1.  **Racemose:**
    *   **Description:** Main axis has indeterminate growth, continues to grow.
    *   **Arrangement:** Flowers in **acropetal succession** (older at base, younger at top).
    *   **Example:** Mustard, Radish.
2.  **Cymose:**
    *   **Description:** Main axis terminates in a flower, determinate growth.
    *   **Arrangement:** Flowers in **basipetal succession** (terminal/oldest first, younger below).
    *   **Example:** Jasmine, Bougainvillea, Hibiscus.

---

## Placentation: Arrangement of Ovules

*   Arrangement of ovules within the ovary.
*   Ovules attached to **placenta**.

---

### Types of Placentation

| Type | Description | Example(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marginal** | Placenta forms ridge along ventral suture, ovules in two rows. | Pea, Bean |
| **Axile** | Placenta axial (center), ovules attached in multilocular ovary. | Tomato, Lemon, Hibiscus |
| **Parietal** | Ovules on inner wall/peripheral part. Ovary one-chambered (may have false septum). | Mustard, Cucumber, Papaya |
| **Basal** | Placenta at base of ovary, single ovule attached. | Sunflower, Marigold, Rice |
| **Free Central** | Ovules on central axis, no septa. Ovary unilocular. | Dianthus, Primrose |
