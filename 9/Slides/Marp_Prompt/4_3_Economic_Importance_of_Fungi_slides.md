# Economic Importance of Fungi

---

## Useful Role of Fungi

### 1. Breweries (Alcoholic Fermentation)

*   Fungi (yeasts, especially *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) are essential for alcoholic beverages.
*   **Process:** Yeast ferments sugars from grains to produce **ethanol (alcohol)** and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**.
*   **Steps:** Malting → Mashing (produces wort) → Boiling (with hops) → Fermentation (yeast added) → Maturation → Packaging.

### 2. Bakeries (Leavening of Bread)

*   *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast) makes dough rise.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Mixing:** Flour, water, salt, yeast.
    2.  **Kneading:** Develops gluten network.
    3.  **Fermentation (Proofing/Rising):** Yeast ferments sugars, produces **CO₂ gas** (trapped in gluten), causing dough to rise.
    4.  **Baking:** Heat expands CO₂, kills yeast, sets gluten, evaporates alcohol.

### 3. Cheese Processing (Ripening)

*   Certain fungi (molds, e.g., *Penicillium*) develop unique flavors, aromas, textures.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Initial Cheesemaking:** Milk curdled, curd separated.
    2.  **Inoculation with Fungi:** Spores introduced (e.g., *Penicillium roqueforti* for blue cheeses, *P. camemberti* for soft-ripened).
    3.  **Ripening (Aging):** Fungi secrete enzymes (proteases, lipases) that break down proteins/fats, creating flavor/texture.
*   **Examples:** Roquefort, Stilton (blue cheeses); Camembert, Brie (soft-ripened).

### 4. Mushroom Cultivation

*   Growing edible mushrooms (fleshy fruiting bodies of fungi).
*   Valuable food source (protein, vitamins).
*   Uses plant waste materials.
*   **Process (e.g., Button Mushroom):**
    1.  **Compost Preparation:** Nutrient-rich substrate from agricultural waste.
    2.  **Spawning:** Mushroom mycelium ("spawn") mixed into pasteurized compost.
    3.  **Casing:** Layer of peat moss/chalk applied to stimulate fruiting.
    4.  **Pinning:** Tiny mushroom primordia ("pins") appear.
    5.  **Harvesting:** Mature mushrooms picked, often in "flushes."
