# Digestive System

## Organs, Glands, Functions, and Processes

---

## 1. Overview of the Digestive System

*   Complex network of organs and glands.
*   Breaks down food into smaller molecules for absorption and utilization.
*   Consists of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory organs.

---

## 2. Organs and Glands of the Digestive System and Their Functions

### 2.1 Organs of the Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract

*   **Mouth:** Mechanical (chewing) and chemical (saliva) digestion begins.
*   **Pharynx:** Passageway for both food and air.
*   **Esophagus:** Transports food to stomach via peristalsis.
*   **Stomach:** Storage and mixing, churns food with gastric juices (chyme). Chemical digestion of proteins begins.
*   **Small Intestine:** Primary site for most chemical digestion and nutrient absorption.
    *   **Duodenum:** Mixes with pancreatic/liver juices.
    *   **Jejunum:** Most nutrient absorption.
    *   **Ileum:** Final section, remaining nutrient absorption.
*   **Large Intestine:** Absorbs water/electrolytes, forms feces.
*   **Rectum:** Stores feces.
*   **Anus:** Expels feces.

---

### 2.2 Accessory Digestive Glands

*   Produce digestive juices and enzymes, not part of GI tract.
*   **Salivary Glands:** Produce saliva (moistens food, initiates carb digestion).
*   **Liver:** Produces bile (emulsifies fats).
*   **Gallbladder:** Stores and concentrates bile.
*   **Pancreas:** Produces pancreatic juice (digestive enzymes for carbs, fats, proteins) and bicarbonate (neutralizes chyme).

---

## 3. Enzymes and Their Functions in Digestion

*   Biological catalysts that speed up food breakdown.
*   **Carbohydrate-Digesting Enzymes:**
    *   **Salivary Amylase (Ptyalin):** Mouth, begins starch breakdown.
    *   **Pancreatic Amylase:** Small intestine, continues starch breakdown.
    *   **Disaccharidases:** Small intestine, break disaccharides to monosaccharides.
*   **Protein-Digesting Enzymes:**
    *   **Pepsin:** Stomach, begins protein breakdown.
    *   **Trypsin & Chymotrypsin:** Pancreas, continue protein breakdown.
    *   **Peptidases:** Small intestine, break peptides to amino acids.
*   **Fat-Digesting Enzymes (Lipases):**
    *   **Lingual Lipase:** Mouth (minor).
    *   **Gastric Lipase:** Stomach (minor).
    *   **Pancreatic Lipase:** Pancreas, primary fat digestion (with bile).

## 4. Processes of Digestion, Absorption, and Assimilation

### 4.1 Digestion

*   Breaking down large, insoluble food molecules into small, water-soluble ones.
*   **Mechanical Digestion:** Physical breakdown (chewing, churning).
*   **Chemical Digestion:** Enzymatic breakdown (complex to simpler units).

---

### 4.2 Absorption

*   Digested nutrients pass from small intestine into bloodstream or lymphatic system.
*   Small intestine highly adapted (folds, villi, microvilli).
*   **Monosaccharides, Amino Acids:** Absorbed into bloodstream.
*   **Fatty Acids & Glycerol:** Absorbed into lymphatic system (as chylomicrons), then bloodstream.
*   **Water & Electrolytes:** Absorbed throughout GI tract, especially large intestine.

---

### 4.3 Assimilation

*   Absorbed nutrients transported by blood to cells/tissues.
*   Utilized for metabolic activities:
    *   **Energy Production:** Glucose for ATP.
    *   **Growth and Repair:** Amino acids for protein synthesis.
    *   **Storage:** Excess nutrients stored (glycogen, triglycerides).

---

## 5. Peristalsis

*   **Meaning:** Involuntary, wave-like muscular contractions in digestive tract walls.
*   **Role in Digestion:**
    *   **Propulsion:** Moves food along GI tract.
    *   **Mixing:** Churns food with digestive juices.
    *   **Efficiency:** Ensures optimal digestion and absorption.
