# Food Classes & Balanced Diet

## A Comprehensive Guide

---

## 1. Classes of Food

*   Broadly categorized into **macronutrients** and **micronutrients**.

---

### 1.1 Macronutrients

*   Required in large quantities.
*   Provide energy and building blocks.

---

#### 1.1.1 Carbohydrates

*   **Functions:** Primary energy source (brain, muscles), energy storage (glycogen), protein sparing, preventing ketosis.
*   **Sources:** Grains, bread, pasta, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, legumes, sugars.

---

#### 1.1.2 Fats (Lipids)

*   **Functions:** Concentrated energy source, insulation, organ protection, cell membrane component, hormone production, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), nerve function, flavor, satiety.
*   **Sources:** Oils, butter, nuts, seeds, avocados, fatty fish, dairy.

---

#### 1.1.3 Proteins

*   **Functions:** Building/repairing tissues, enzyme production, hormone production, structural support (keratin, collagen), transport/storage (hemoglobin), immune function (antibodies), fluid/pH balance, secondary energy source.
*   **Sources:** Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, seeds.

---

### 1.2 Micronutrients

*   Required in smaller quantities.
*   Essential for various metabolic processes and overall health.

---

#### 1.2.1 Mineral Salts

*   Inorganic substances vital for bodily functions.
*   **Calcium:** Bones/teeth, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting. (Sources: Dairy, leafy greens).
*   **Iodine:** Thyroid hormones (metabolism, growth). (Sources: Iodized salt, seafood).
*   **Iron:** Hemoglobin (O₂ transport), myoglobin (O₂ storage), energy metabolism. (Sources: Red meat, beans, spinach).
*   **Sodium:** Fluid balance, nerve impulses, muscle contraction, BP regulation. (Sources: Table salt, processed foods).

---

#### 1.2.2 Vitamins

*   Organic compounds essential for growth/nutrition, not synthesized by body.
*   **Vitamin A:** Vision, immune, cell growth, healthy skin. (Deficiency: Night blindness, xerophthalmia).
*   **B Vitamins:** Energy metabolism, RBC production, brain/nerve function. (Deficiency: Beriberi, Pellagra, Megaloblastic Anemia).
*   **Vitamin C:** Antioxidant, collagen, wound healing, iron absorption. (Deficiency: Scurvy).
*   **Vitamin D:** Calcium/phosphate absorption, bones/teeth. (Deficiency: Rickets, Osteomalacia).
*   **Vitamin E:** Antioxidant, protects cells. (Deficiency: Rare, neurological problems).
*   **Vitamin K:** Blood clotting, bone health. (Deficiency: Impaired clotting).

---

#### 1.2.3 Water

*   **Functions:** Body temperature regulation, transport medium, chemical reactions, lubrication/cushioning, waste excretion, digestion/absorption.
*   **Sources:** Drinking water, beverages, fruits, vegetables.

---

## 2. Role of Cellulose in Our Diet

*   Complex carbohydrate in plant cell walls. Humans cannot digest.
*   **Importance (Dietary Fiber/Roughage):**
    *   Promotes digestive health (prevents constipation).
    *   Aids in waste elimination.
    *   May reduce risk of certain diseases (diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, some cancers).
    *   Blood sugar control.
    *   Satiety (beneficial for weight management).
*   **Sources:** Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes.

---

## 3. Balanced Diet

*   Provides all essential nutrients in right proportions and adequate amounts.
*   Meets body's needs for growth, maintenance, optimal health.
*   **Importance:**
    *   Optimal Growth and Development.
    *   Maintains Good Health.
    *   Prevents Deficiency Diseases.
    *   Boosts Immunity.
    *   Provides Energy.
    *   Manages Weight.
    *   Reduces Risk of Chronic Diseases.
    *   Enhances Mental Well-being.

---

## 4. Malnutrition and Deficiency Diseases

*   **Malnutrition:** Deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in energy/nutrient intake.
*   Includes undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity.

---

### 4.1 Kwashiorkor

*   **Causes:** Severe protein deficiency (high carb, low protein diet).
*   **Symptoms:** Edema (swelling), stunted growth, muscle wasting (masked by edema), skin/hair changes, enlarged liver, apathy, irritability, weakened immune system.
*   **Prevention:** Adequate protein intake, breastfeeding, diversified diet, nutritional education.

---

### 4.2 Marasmus

*   **Causes:** Severe deficiency of all nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins). Overall energy and protein deficit.
*   **Symptoms:** Severe wasting ("skin and bones"), stunted growth, drastic weight loss, wrinkled skin, "old man's face," weakness, apathy, chronic diarrhea, weakened immune system.
*   **Prevention:** Adequate calorie/nutrient intake, food security, early intervention, nutritional support programs.
