# Five Kingdom Classification

*   Proposed by R.H. Whittaker in 1969.
*   Based on:
    *   Complexity of cell structure (Prokaryotic/Eukaryotic).
    *   Complexity of body organization (Unicellular/Multicellular).
    *   Mode of nutrition (Autotrophic/Heterotrophic).
    *   Phylogenetic relationships.

---

## 1. Kingdom Monera

*   Unicellular prokaryotic organisms. Simplest and most ancient.
*   **Main Characteristics:**
    *   **Prokaryotic Cells:** No true nucleus, no membrane-bound organelles. Genetic material in nucleoid.
    *   **Cell Wall:** Most have peptidoglycan.
    *   **Nutrition:** Diverse (Photosynthetic/Chemosynthetic Autotrophic, Saprophytic/Parasitic Heterotrophic).
    *   **Reproduction:** Primarily asexual (binary fission).
*   **Examples:** Bacteria (Cocci, Bacilli, Spirilla), Cyanobacteria.

---

## 2. Kingdom Protista

*   Unicellular eukaryotic organisms. Ancestors of multicellular eukaryotes.
*   **Main Characteristics:**
    *   **Eukaryotic Cells:** True nucleus, membrane-bound organelles.
    *   **Locomotion:** Many motile (Pseudopodia, Cilia, Flagella).
    *   **Nutrition:** Various modes (Autotrophic, Heterotrophic, Mixotrophic).
    *   **Reproduction:** Asexual (binary fission) and sexual (conjugation).
*   **Examples:** *Amoeba*, *Paramecium*, *Euglena*.

---

## 3. Kingdom Fungi

*   Eukaryotic, heterotrophic organisms. Lack chlorophyll.
*   **Main Characteristics:**
    *   **Eukaryotic Cells:** True nucleus, membrane-bound organelles.
    *   **Body Structure:** Most multicellular (hyphae forming mycelium), some unicellular (yeast).
    *   **Cell Wall:** Made of **chitin**.
    *   **Nutrition:** Heterotrophic (Saprophytic or Parasitic). Some symbiotic (lichens).
    *   **Reproduction:** Asexual (spores, budding) and sexual.
*   **Examples:** Mushrooms, molds, yeasts.

---

## 4. Kingdom Plantae

*   Multicellular, eukaryotic, and autotrophic organisms. Primary producers.
*   **Main Characteristics:**
    *   **Eukaryotic Cells:** True nucleus, membrane-bound organelles, chloroplasts.
    *   **Cell Wall:** Made of **cellulose**.
    *   **Nutrition:** **Autotrophic** (photosynthesis).
    *   **Body Organization:** Well-differentiated body with specialized tissues and organs.

---

### Subdivisions of Kingdom Plantae

#### (i) Thallophyta (Algae)

*   **Plant Body:** Simple, undifferentiated **thallus**. Lack true roots, stems, leaves.
*   **Habitat:** Predominantly aquatic.
*   **Examples:** *Spirogyra*, *Laminaria*.

---

#### (ii) Bryophyta (Mosses)

*   **Plant Body:** More differentiated than algae, simple stem-like/leaf-like structures. Lack true roots.
*   **Habitat:** "Amphibians of the plant kingdom" (moist, shady, require water for reproduction).
*   **Vascular System:** Lack specialized vascular system.
*   **Examples:** Mosses (*Funaria*), Liverworts (*Marchantia*).

---

#### (iii) Pteridophyta (Ferns)

*   **Plant Body:** First terrestrial plants with true roots, stems, and leaves.
*   **Vascular System:** Well-developed (xylem and phloem).
*   **Reproduction:** By spores in sporangia.
*   **Examples:** Ferns (*Dryopteris*), Horsetails (*Equisetum*).

---

#### (iv) Spermatophyta (Seed Plants)

*   Most advanced group. Presence of **seeds** for reproduction.
*   **Gymnosperms:** "Naked" seeds (not enclosed in fruit). (e.g., *Pinus*, *Cycas*).
*   **Angiosperms (Flowering Plants):** Seeds enclosed within a fruit. Largest and most diverse. (e.g., Mango, Rose).

---

## 5. Kingdom Animalia

*   Multicellular, eukaryotic, and heterotrophic organisms.
*   Ability to move and respond to stimuli.
*   **Main Characteristics:**
    *   **Eukaryotic Cells:** No cell walls or chloroplasts.
    *   **Nutrition:** **Heterotrophic** (ingest food).
    *   **Body Organization:** Well-differentiated tissues, organs, organ systems.
    *   **Motility:** Most are motile.

---

### Subdivisions of Kingdom Animalia

#### (A) Non-Chordates

*   Animals without a notochord.
*   **Phylum Porifera (Sponges):** Cellular level, canal system.
*   **Phylum Coelenterata (Cnidaria):** Hollow body, stinging cells.
*   **Phylum Platyhelminthes (Flatworms):** Dorso-ventrally flattened, many parasitic.
*   **Phylum Nematoda (Roundworms):** Cylindrical body, many parasitic.
*   **Phylum Annelida (Segmented Worms):** Segmented body, true coelom.
*   **Phylum Arthropoda (Jointed-legged Animals):** Largest phylum, chitinous exoskeleton, jointed appendages.
*   **Phylum Mollusca (Soft-bodied Animals):** Soft body, usually shelled, muscular foot.
*   **Phylum Echinodermata (Spiny-skinned Animals):** Exclusively marine, spiny skin, water vascular system.

---

#### (B) Chordates

*   Animals with a **notochord** at some stage of life. Also dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal gill slits, post-anal tail.

---

##### Class Pisces (Fish):

*   Aquatic, streamlined body. Gills for breathing, fins for locomotion. Cold-blooded.
*   **Examples:** Rohu, Shark.

---

##### Class Amphibia (Amphibians):

*   Live on land and in water. Moist skin for respiration. Lay eggs in water. Cold-blooded.
*   **Examples:** Frogs, Toads.

---

##### Class Reptilia (Reptiles):

*   Primarily terrestrial. Dry, scaly skin. Breathe through lungs. Lay shelled eggs on land. Cold-blooded.
*   **Examples:** Lizards, Snakes.

---

##### Class Aves (Birds):

*   Feathers, forelimbs modified into wings. Hollow bones. Warm-blooded. Lay hard-shelled eggs.
*   **Examples:** Crow, Pigeon.

---
