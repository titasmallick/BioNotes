# Tissues: The Fabric of Life

---

## Introduction to Tissues

*   In multicellular organisms, cells with similar structures and functions organize into **tissues**.
*   Study of tissues: **Histology**.
*   Tissues form organs, organs form organ systems.
*   Specialized for specific functions, increasing efficiency.

---

## Plant Tissues

*   Classified into **meristematic** and **permanent** tissues.

---

### 1. Meristematic Tissues (The Growth Tissues)

*   Composed of actively dividing cells.
*   **Location:** Growing regions (root/stem tips, cambium).
*   **Structure:** Small, thin-walled, dense cytoplasm, prominent nucleus.
*   **Function:** Responsible for primary (length) and secondary (girth) growth.
*   **Role:** Continuous growth and development.

---

#### Types of Meristematic Tissues

| Type | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apical Meristem** | Tips of roots and shoots. | Increases length (primary growth). |
| **Lateral Meristem** | On the sides of stems and roots (e.g., cambium). | Increases girth/diameter (secondary growth). |
| **Intercalary Meristem** | At the base of leaves or internodes. | Growth of leaves and internodes. |

---

### 2. Permanent Tissues (The Specialized Tissues)

*   Derived from meristematic tissues, lost ability to divide.
*   Differentiated for specific functions.

---

#### a) Simple Permanent Tissues (Single cell type)

| Type | Structure | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parenchyma** | Thin-walled, isodiametric, intercellular spaces. | Throughout plant (e.g., cortex, pith, mesophyll). | Storage, photosynthesis (chlorenchyma), buoyancy (aerenchyma). |
| **Collenchyma** | Elongated, unevenly thickened corners. | Leaf stalks, below stem epidermis. | Provides mechanical support and flexibility to young parts. |
| **Sclerenchyma** | Thick-walled, lignified, dead at maturity. Fibers (long), sclereids (short). | Stems, roots, leaf veins, and hard coverings of seeds and nuts. | Mechanical strength and rigidity. |

---

#### b) Complex Permanent Tissues (Multiple cell types)

*   Also known as **vascular tissues**.
*   **Xylem:**
    *   **Components:** Tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers.
    *   **Function:** Conducts water and minerals from roots. Provides mechanical support.
    *   **Role:** Transpiration and water transport.
*   **Phloem:**
    *   **Components:** Sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, phloem fibers.
    *   **Function:** Transports food (sugars) from leaves.
    *   **Role:** Translocation of organic food.

---

## Animal Tissues

*   Classified into four main types: **epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous**.

---

### 1. Epithelial Tissue (The Covering Tissue)

*   Forms continuous layer, covers body surfaces, lines cavities, forms glands.
*   Cells tightly packed.
*   **Location:** Skin, lining of organs, blood vessels.
*   **Function:** Protection, absorption, filtration, secretion, sensation.
*   **Role:** Barrier, nutrient absorption, waste excretion.

---

#### Types of Epithelial Tissues

| Type | Structure | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Squamous** | Thin, flat cells. | Lining of blood vessels, lung air sacs. | Filtration and diffusion. |
| **Cuboidal** | Cube-shaped cells. | Kidney tubules, gland ducts. | Secretion and absorption. |
| **Columnar** | Tall, pillar-like cells. | Lining of stomach and intestine. | Secretion and absorption. |
| **Ciliated** | Columnar/cuboidal with cilia. | Respiratory tract, fallopian tubes. | Moves mucus and substances. |
| **Glandular** | Modified epithelial cells. | Glands (salivary, sweat). | Secretion of enzymes, hormones. |

---

### 2. Connective Tissue (The Supporting Tissue)

*   Most abundant and widely distributed.
*   Connects, supports, binds other tissues/organs.
*   Cells scattered in large extracellular matrix.
*   **Location:** Bone, cartilage, blood, fat.
*   **Function:** Binding, support, protection, insulation, transport.
*   **Role:** Structural framework, transport, energy storage, immunity.

---

#### Types of Connective Tissues

| Type | Description | Examples | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Areolar** | Loose network of fibers. | Beneath skin, around nerves/vessels. | Fills space, supports organs, fights infection. |
| **Adipose** | Fat cells (adipocytes). | Under skin, around organs. | Stores fat, insulation, cushioning. |
| **Fibrous** | Densely packed collagen fibers. | Tendons, ligaments. | Strong connection and support. |
| **Cartilage** | Chondrocytes in rubbery matrix. | Ends of bones, nose, ears, trachea. | Flexible support, reduces friction. |
| **Bone** | Osteocytes in rigid, calcified matrix. | Skeleton. | Support, protection, movement. |
| **Blood** | RBCs, WBCs, platelets in plasma. | Within blood vessels. | Transports Oâ‚‚, nutrients, hormones, waste. |

### 3. Muscular Tissue (The Movement Tissue)

*   Composed of elongated cells (muscle fibers) capable of contraction.
*   Responsible for all types of movement.
*   **Location:** Limbs, heart, walls of internal organs.
*   **Structure:** Elongated cells with contractile proteins (actin, myosin).
*   **Function:** Movement and locomotion.
*   **Role:** Voluntary/involuntary movements, posture.

---

#### Types of Muscular Tissues

| Type | Structure | Control | Location | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Striated (Skeletal)** | Long, cylindrical, unbranched, striations. | Voluntary | Attached to bones. | Voluntary movements. |
| **Unstriated (Smooth)** | Spindle-shaped, non-striated. | Involuntary | Walls of internal organs. | Involuntary movements. |
| **Cardiac** | Branched, striated, intercalated discs. | Involuntary | Wall of the heart. | Pumping of blood. |

### 4. Nervous Tissue (The Control Tissue)

*   Main component of nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and nerves).
*   **Location:** Brain, spinal cord, nerves.
*   **Structure:** Neurons (cell body, dendrites, axon) and glial cells.
*   **Function:** Generation and transmission of nerve impulses.
*   **Role:** Regulates/controls body functions, responds to stimuli, consciousness, memory, emotion.
