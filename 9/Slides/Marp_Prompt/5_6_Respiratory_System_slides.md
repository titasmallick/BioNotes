# Respiratory System

## Organs, Mechanism, Respiration, and Adaptations

---

## 1. Structures of the Respiratory System

*   Exchanges gases (O₂ and CO₂) between body and external environment.
*   Divided into upper and lower respiratory tracts.

---

### 1.1 Upper Respiratory Tract

*   **Nose and Nasal Cavity:** Primary entry, filters, warms, humidifies air. Olfactory receptors.
*   **Pharynx (Throat):** Passageway for air and food.
*   **Larynx (Voice Box):** Contains vocal cords, produces sound. Epiglottis prevents food entry.

---

### 1.2 Lower Respiratory Tract

*   **Trachea (Windpipe):** Rigid tube, C-shaped cartilage rings, lined with ciliated epithelium.
*   **Bronchi:** Trachea divides into two, leading to lungs, branch into bronchioles.
*   **Bronchioles:** Small airways, regulate airflow.
*   **Lungs:** Primary organs, in thoracic cavity, protected by rib cage.
*   **Alveoli (Air Sacs):** Tiny, thin-walled sacs, primary sites of gas exchange.
*   **Pleura:** Double-layered membrane surrounding each lung, with fluid for lubrication.

---

## 2. Mechanism of Breathing (Ventilation)

*   Moving air into (inspiration) and out of (expiration) lungs.
*   Driven by pressure changes in thoracic cavity.

---

### 2.1 Role of Diaphragm and Intercostal Muscles

*   **Diaphragm:** Large, dome-shaped muscle, primary muscle of respiration.
    *   **Inspiration:** Contracts, flattens, moves downward.
*   **Intercostal Muscles:** Between ribs.
    *   **External:** Contract during inspiration, pull ribs upward/outward.
    *   **Internal:** Contract during forced expiration, pull ribs downward/inward.

---

### 2.2 The Breathing Process

*   **Inspiration (Inhaling):**
    1.  Diaphragm contracts, external intercostals contract.
    2.  Thoracic cavity volume increases.
    3.  Intrapulmonary pressure decreases (< atmospheric).
    4.  Air flows into lungs.
*   **Expiration (Exhaling):**
    1.  Muscles relax (quiet breathing).
    2.  Thoracic cavity volume decreases (elastic recoil).
    3.  Intrapulmonary pressure increases (> atmospheric).
    4.  Air flows out of lungs.
    *   Forced expiration involves internal intercostals and abdominal muscles.

---

## 3. Tissue Respiration (Cellular Respiration) and Heat Production

*   Metabolic process where cells break down organic molecules (glucose) to release ATP.
*   Occurs mainly in mitochondria.
*   **Process:** Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy (ATP) + Heat
*   **Heat Production:** Exothermic process, ~60% energy released as heat. Crucial for thermoregulation in warm-blooded animals.

---

## 4. Differences Between Anaerobic Respiration in Plants and Humans

*   Occurs in absence of oxygen, produces less ATP.
*   **Anaerobic Respiration in Plants (Alcoholic Fermentation):**
    *   **Conditions:** Oxygen scarce (e.g., waterlogged soils, yeast).
    *   **Equation:** Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + ATP.
    *   **End Products:** Ethanol and CO₂.
*   **Anaerobic Respiration in Humans (Lactic Acid Fermentation):**
    *   **Conditions:** Muscle cells during intense activity (insufficient O₂).
    *   **Equation:** Glucose → Lactic Acid + ATP.
    *   **End Product:** Lactic acid (causes fatigue, cramps).

---

## 5. Gaseous Transport

*   Efficient transport of O₂ and CO₂ between lungs and tissues. Blood is primary medium.
*   **Oxygen Transport:**
    *   **Hemoglobin:** ~97% bound to hemoglobin in RBCs (oxyhemoglobin).
    *   **Dissolved in Plasma:** ~3%.
*   **Carbon Dioxide Transport:**
    *   **Bicarbonate Ions (HCO₃⁻):** ~70% (formed in RBCs, transported in plasma).
    *   **Carbaminohemoglobin:** ~20-25% bound to hemoglobin.
    *   **Dissolved in Plasma:** ~7-10%.

---

## 6. Respiratory Volumes and Capacities

*   Measures of air movement and lung capacity.
*   **Tidal Volume (TV):** Normal breath (~500 mL).
*   **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):** Max forced inhale (above TV).
*   **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):** Max forced exhale (below TV).
*   **Residual Volume (RV):** Air remaining after max forced exhale.
*   **Vital Capacity (VC):** Max exchangeable air (TV + IRV + ERV).
*   **Total Lung Capacity (TLC):** Max air lungs can hold (VC + RV).
*   **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):** Air remaining after normal exhale (ERV + RV).

---

## 7. Effect of Altitude on Breathing

*   Lower atmospheric pressure at high altitudes → lower PO₂.
*   **Immediate Responses (Acclimatization):**
    *   **Increased Breathing Rate (Hyperventilation):** Compensates for low O₂.
    *   **Increased Heart Rate:** Delivers more O₂ to tissues.
*   **Long-Term Adaptations:**
    *   **Increased Red Blood Cell Production:** More erythropoietin, more RBCs.
    *   **Increased Capillary Density:** Improves O₂ delivery.
    *   **Increased Myoglobin:** Stores O₂ in muscle cells.

---

## 8. Asphyxiation and Hypoxia

*   Both relate to insufficient oxygen.
*   **Asphyxiation (Suffocation):**
    *   **Definition:** Severe O₂ deficiency due to interference with normal breathing.
    *   **Causes:** Airway obstruction, drowning, insufficient O₂ environment.
    *   **Consequences:** CO₂ buildup, O₂ lack, brain damage, death.
*   **Hypoxia:**
    *   **Definition:** Body/region deprived of adequate O₂ supply at tissue level.
    *   **Causes:** Hypoxemic (low O₂ in blood), Anemic (reduced O₂-carrying capacity), Ischemic (inadequate blood flow), Histotoxic (tissues unable to use O₂).
    *   **Symptoms:** Mild (headache) to severe (confusion, organ damage).
