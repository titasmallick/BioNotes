# Teeth: Structure, Types, Functions, and Dental Formula

---

## 1. Structure of a Tooth

*   Complex biological structure for mastication (chewing), speech, aesthetics.

---

### 1.1 Main Anatomical Parts

*   **Crown:** Visible part above gum line, covered by enamel.
*   **Neck (Cervix):** Narrow region where crown meets root, at gum line.
*   **Root:** Portion embedded in jawbone, anchors tooth.

---

### 1.2 Layers of a Tooth

*   **Enamel:** Outermost layer of crown, hardest substance in body. Protects, allows chewing.
*   **Dentin:** Yellowish, bone-like, beneath enamel/cementum. Bulk of tooth, sensitive.
*   **Cementum:** Calcified substance covering root. Anchors tooth to jawbone.
*   **Pulp:** Innermost part, contains blood vessels, nerves, connective tissue. Nourishes dentin, provides sensation.

---

### 1.3 Supporting Structures

*   **Periodontal Ligament (PDL):** Connects tooth root to jawbone, acts as shock absorber.
*   **Gingiva (Gums):** Soft tissue that surrounds teeth, protective seal.
*   **Alveolar Bone:** Part of jawbone supporting tooth roots.

## 2. Functions of Different Types of Teeth

*   Humans have two sets: deciduous (baby) and permanent (32 in adult).

---

### Types of Teeth and Functions

*   **Incisors (8):** Front teeth, chisel-shaped. Function: Cutting and biting food.
*   **Canines (4):** Pointed, cone-shaped. Function: Tearing and piercing tough foods.
*   **Premolars (Bicuspids) (8):** Two cusps. Function: Tearing and crushing food.
*   **Molars (12):** Rearmost, large, broad, flat surfaces. Function: Grinding and mashing food.

---

## 3. Dental Formula of an Adult

*   Concise way to represent number of each tooth type in one half of jaws.
*   **2(I 2/2, C 1/1, PM 2/2, M 3/3) = 32**

---

### Breaking Down the Dental Formula

*   **2:** Multiplies for both sides of mouth.
*   **I 2/2:** 2 Incisors in upper half, 2 in lower half.
*   **C 1/1:** 1 Canine in upper half, 1 in lower half.
*   **PM 2/2:** 2 Premolars in upper half, 2 in lower half.
*   **M 3/3:** 3 Molars in upper half, 3 in lower half.
*   **Calculation:** (2+1+2+3) upper + (2+1+2+3) lower = 8 + 8 = 16 teeth per half.
*   Total teeth: 16 * 2 = **32 teeth**.
*   Includes third molars (wisdom teeth).
