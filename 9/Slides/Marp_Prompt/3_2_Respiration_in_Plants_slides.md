# Respiration in Plants: The Energy of Life

---

## Introduction: Why Do Plants Respire?

*   Plants need energy for life processes (growth, mineral absorption, transport).
*   **Respiration:** Biochemical process breaking down organic food (glucose) to release energy as **ATP**.
*   Occurs in every living cell, 24 hours a day.

### Respiration vs. Photosynthesis

| Feature | Photosynthesis | Respiration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | Anabolic (builds glucose) | Catabolic (breaks down glucose) |
| **Energy** | Stores energy from sunlight | Releases chemical energy |
| **Location** | Chloroplasts | Cytoplasm and mitochondria |
| **Time** | Only in light | Continuously (day and night) |
| **Gases** | Uses CO₂, releases O₂ | Uses O₂, releases CO₂ |

## Gaseous Exchange in Plants

*   Plants take in O₂ and release CO₂. No specialized respiratory system.
*   **In Leaves:** Through **stomata**.
*   **In Stems:** Through **lenticels** (woody stems).
*   **In Roots:** Across moist surface of root hairs (from soil air spaces).

## Outline of the Respiration Process

*   Complete breakdown of glucose is a complex, multi-step process.

---

### 1. Glycolysis (The First Step)

*   **Location:** Cytoplasm.
*   **Process:** Glucose (6C) broken down into two molecules of **pyruvic acid** (3C).
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** Does **not** require oxygen. Common to both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
*   **Significance:** Initial stage, produces 2 ATP and pyruvic acid.

---

### 2. Krebs Cycle (The Citric Acid Cycle)

*   **Location:** Mitochondria.
*   **Process:** Pyruvic acid completely broken down in cyclic reactions. Releases CO₂, NADH, FADH₂, small ATP.
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** Occurs only if **oxygen is present**.
*   **Significance:** Main energy-releasing phase of aerobic respiration. High-energy molecules (NADH, FADH₂) proceed to ETS.

## Types of Respiration

### 1. Aerobic Respiration

*   Occurs in the **presence of oxygen**.
*   Complete breakdown of glucose to CO₂ and water.
*   Releases large amount of energy (~38 ATP).
*   **Equation:** C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + 38 ATP

---

### 2. Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)

*   Occurs in the **absence of oxygen**.
*   Incomplete breakdown of glucose.
*   **In plants and yeast:** **Alcoholic fermentation** (pyruvic acid → ethanol + CO₂).
*   Releases much smaller amount of energy (only 2 ATP).
*   **Equation:** C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + 2 ATP

## Experiments on Respiration

### 1. Experiment to Show that Carbon Dioxide is Produced During Respiration

*   **Setup:** Flask A (germinating seeds), Flask B (boiled/dead seeds - control). Pass gas through limewater.
*   **Observation:** Gas from Flask A turns limewater milky. Gas from Flask B shows no change.
*   **Conclusion:** Germinating seeds (respiring) produce CO₂.

### 2. Experiment to Show that Heat is Produced During Respiration

*   **Setup:** Thermos Flask A (germinating seeds), Thermos Flask B (boiled/dead seeds - control). Insert thermometers.
*   **Observation:** Thermometer in Flask A shows significant temperature rise. Flask B shows no change.
*   **Conclusion:** Germinating seeds produce heat during respiration.
