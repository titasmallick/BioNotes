# Fertilisation: The Fusion of Gametes

---

## Introduction: What is Fertilisation?

*   Fusion of male gamete (from pollen) with female gamete (egg cell in ovule).
*   Forms a **zygote**.
*   In angiosperms, involves **double fertilization**.

---

## Events from Pollination to Fertilisation

1.  **Germination of Pollen Grain:** Pollen absorbs nutrients from stigma, forms **pollen tube** through germ pore.
2.  **Growth of Pollen Tube:** Pollen tube (carrying two male gametes and tube nucleus) grows through stigma/style towards ovary. Chemotropic movement.
3.  **Entry into Ovule and Embryo Sac:** Pollen tube enters ovule (usually via micropyle), then penetrates embryo sac.
4.  **Release of Male Gametes:** Pollen tube ruptures, releases two male gametes into embryo sac.
5.  **Formation of Zygote:** One male gamete fuses with egg cell (**syngamy**) → diploid **zygote (2n)**.

## Double Fertilization and Triple Fusion: A Unique Angiosperm Feature

*   Two fusion events occur in embryo sac.

---

### Triple Fusion

*   Second male gamete fuses with two **polar nuclei** (in center of embryo sac).
*   Forms **triploid (3n) Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN)**.

---

### Double Fertilization

1.  **Syngamy:** Male gamete + Egg cell → Zygote (2n).
2.  **Triple Fusion:** Male gamete + 2 Polar Nuclei → PEN (3n).

---

### Significance of Double Fertilization

*   Ensures nutritive tissue (endosperm) forms only if fertilization is successful.
*   Zygote develops into **embryo**.
*   PEN develops into **endosperm** (provides nourishment to embryo).

| Event | Fusion Of | Product | Ploidy | Fate of Product |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Syngamy** | Male Gamete + Egg Cell | Zygote | Diploid (2n) | Develops into the Embryo |
| **Triple Fusion** | Male Gamete + 2 Polar Nuclei | Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN) | Triploid (3n) | Develops into the Endosperm |

## Fruit and Seed: The Products of Fertilisation

*   After fertilization, flower parts wither.
*   Ovary develops into **fruit**.
*   Ovules develops into **seeds**.

---

### Fruit

*   **Definition:** Mature or ripened ovary, develops after fertilization.
*   Ovary wall develops into **pericarp** (fruit wall).
*   **Significance:**
    1.  **Protection of Seeds:** Protects from injury, harsh conditions, pests.
    2.  **Seed Dispersal:** Attracts animals, aids dispersal by wind/animals.
    3.  **Source of Food:** For humans and animals.

---

### Seed

*   **Definition:** Mature ovule, contains embryo and food store, enclosed in seed coat.
*   **Significance:**
    1.  **Contains the Embryo:** Young, dormant plant.
    2.  **Nourishment for Embryo:** Stores food for germination.
    3.  **Dispersal:** Unit of dispersal for plant species.
    4.  **Dormancy and Perennation:** Protective seed coat allows survival in unfavorable conditions.
