# The Cell – A Unit of Life

---

## The Cell Theory: A Foundation of Biology

*   Fundamental principle in biology.
*   **1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.**
*   **2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in organisms.**
*   **3. Cells arise from pre-existing cells.** (Rudolf Virchow: "Omnis cellula e cellula").

---

### Modern additions to the cell theory:

*   Cells contain hereditary information (DNA).
*   All cells are basically the same in chemical composition and metabolic activities.
*   Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.

---

## Protoplasm and Cytoplasm: The Living Essence

*   **Protoplasm:** Entire content within the cell membrane ("living substance").
    *   Includes cytoplasm and nucleoplasm.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Part of protoplasm outside nucleus, within cell membrane.
    *   Jelly-like substance, contains cytosol (fluid) and cell organelles.
    *   Site of many metabolic activities.

## A Tale of Two Cells: Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic

| Feature | Prokaryotic Cell | Eukaryotic Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nucleus** | Absent (nucleoid region) | Present (true nucleus, nuclear envelope) |
| **Membrane-bound Organelles** | Absent | Present (mitochondria, ER, Golgi, etc.) |
| **Cell Wall** | Usually present (peptidoglycan) | Present in plants (cellulose) & fungi (chitin); absent in animals |
| **Ribosomes** | 70S type | 80S type (cytoplasm), 70S (mitochondria/chloroplasts) |
| **Size** | Typically small (0.1-5.0 µm) | Typically larger (10-100 µm) |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | More complex, highly organized |
| **Example** | Bacteria, Archaea | Plants, animals, fungi, protists |

## The Great Divide: Plant vs. Animal Cells

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell Wall** | Present (cellulose), rigid outer layer | Absent |
| **Plastids** | Present (chloroplasts, chromoplasts, leucoplasts) | Absent |
| **Vacuoles** | Large, central vacuole (up to 90% volume) | Small, temporary vacuoles (if present) |
| **Centrosome** | Absent (in higher plants) | Present (contains centrioles) |

## The Organelles: A City Within a Cell

*   **Cell Wall (City Walls):** (Plants, fungi, bacteria) Rigid, protective outer layer.
*   **Cell Membrane (City Gatekeeper):** Selectively permeable barrier.
*   **Nucleus (City Hall):** Control center, contains DNA.
    *   **Nucleolus (City Planning Office):** Synthesizes ribosomes.
*   **Mitochondria (Power Plants):** Sites of cellular respiration, produce ATP.
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (Factory and Highway):** Network of membranes.
    *   **Rough ER:** Ribosomes, protein synthesis/modification.
    *   **Smooth ER:** Lipid synthesis, detoxification, Ca²⁺ storage.

---

### The Organelles (continued)

*   **Ribosomes (Construction Workers):** Sites of protein synthesis.
*   **Golgi Bodies (Post Office):** Modifies, sorts, packages proteins/lipids.
*   **Plastids (Solar Power Plants/Warehouses):** (Plant cells)
    *   **Chloroplasts:** Photosynthesis.
    *   **Chromoplasts:** Colored pigments.
    *   **Leucoplasts:** Store food.
*   **Lysosomes (Waste Disposal/Recycling):** (Mainly animal cells) Contain digestive enzymes.
*   **Centrosome (Cell Division Organizer):** (Animal cells) Organizes microtubules for cell division.
*   **Vacuole (Water Tower/Storage Tank):** Large in plants (turgor, storage), small/temporary in animals.
