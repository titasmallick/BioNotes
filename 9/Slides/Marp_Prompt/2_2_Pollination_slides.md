# Pollination: The Transfer of Life

## Introduction: What is Pollination?

*   Transfer of pollen grains from anther (male) to stigma (female).
*   Crucial step in sexual reproduction of flowering plants.
*   Goal: Fertilization, leading to seeds and fruits.

---

## Types of Pollination

### 1. Self-Pollination (Autogamy)

*   Pollen transfer from anther to stigma of **same flower** or another flower on **same plant**.
*   Common in bisexual flowers.
*   **Examples:** Pea, Wheat, Rice, Tomato.

---

#### Self-Pollination: Advantages & Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Certainty:** Almost certain in bisexual flowers. | **No New Varieties:** No gene mixing. |
| **Less Wastage:** Less pollen production needed. | **Reduced Vigor and Vitality:** Continuous self-pollination weakens offspring. |
| **Preservation of Parental Characters:** Maintains purity of race. | **Increased Susceptibility to Diseases:** Lack of genetic variation. |

---

### 2. Cross-Pollination (Allogamy)

*   Pollen transfer from anther of flower on **one plant** to stigma of flower on **another plant of same species**.
*   Introduces genetic variation.
*   **Examples:** Apple, Rose, Hibiscus, Maize.

---

#### Cross-Pollination: Advantages & Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **New Varieties:** New gene combinations, genetic variation. | **Uncertainty:** Depends on external agents. |
| **Increased Vigor and Vitality:** Healthier, more vigorous offspring. | **Wastage of Pollen:** Large amount of pollen produced. |
| **Better Adaptation:** Increased chances of survival in changing environments. | **Potential for Undesirable Characters:** Mixing of genes can combine undesirable traits. |

## Agents of Pollination

*   Cross-pollination requires external agents: abiotic (non-living) or biotic (living).

---

### 1. Pollination by Insects (Entomophily)

*   Most common biotic pollination.
*   Insects (bees, butterflies) visit flowers for nectar.
*   **Characteristic Features of Insect-Pollinated Flowers:**
    *   Large, conspicuous, brightly colored, scented.
    *   Produce nectar.
    *   Sticky or spiny pollen.
    *   Sticky stigma.

---

### 2. Pollination by Wind (Anemophily)

*   Wind carries pollen grains. Common in grasses, many trees.
*   **Characteristic Features of Wind-Pollinated Flowers:**
    *   Small, inconspicuous, no bright colors/scent/nectar.
    *   Large quantity of pollen (compensate for wastage).
    *   Light, dry, non-sticky pollen.
    *   Feathery or bushy stigmas.
    *   Well-exposed stamens.

---

### 3. Pollination by Water (Hydrophily)

*   Rare, in some aquatic plants. Pollen transferred by water currents.
*   **Characteristic Features of Water-Pollinated Flowers:**
    *   Small, inconspicuous, no scent/nectar.
    *   Protected pollen (mucilaginous covering).
    *   Light pollen.
    *   Long, sticky stigmas.
*   **Examples:** *Vallisneria*, *Hydrilla*.

## How Nature Favors Cross-Pollination

*   Mechanisms (outbreeding devices) to encourage cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination.

---

### Mechanisms Favoring Cross-Pollination

1.  **Unisexuality (Dicliny):** Plant bears only male or female flowers (dioecy).
    *   **Example:** Papaya, Date Palm.
2.  **Dichogamy:** Anther and stigma mature at different times.
    *   **Protandry:** Anthers mature before stigma (e.g., Sunflower).
    *   **Protogyny:** Stigma receptive before anthers (e.g., Magnolia).
3.  **Self-Sterility (Self-Incompatibility):** Genetic mechanism prevents self-pollen germination/fertilization.
    *   **Example:** Tobacco, Potato.
4.  **Herkogamy:** Physical barriers between anther and stigma.
    *   **Example:** *Iris* (stigma covered by flap).
