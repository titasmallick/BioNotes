# Seeds and Germination

## The Beginning of a New Plant

---

## Introduction

*   A seed is the final product of sexual reproduction in plants.
*   Contains a dormant embryo, food supply, and protective coat.
*   **Germination:** Process where dormant embryo awakens and grows into a new plant.

---

## Structure of Seeds

*   Broadly classified by number of cotyledons: dicot and monocot.

---

### 1. Structure of a Dicot Seed (Example: Bean Seed)

*   Typical non-endospermic seed (food in cotyledons).
*   **Seed Coat:** Tough outer protective layer (Testa, Tegmen).
*   **Hilum:** Scar where seed attached to fruit.
*   **Micropyle:** Tiny pore near hilum, allows water entry.
*   **Embryo:**
    *   **Cotyledons (2):** Thick, fleshy, store food.
    *   **Embryonic Axis (Tigellum):**
        *   **Radicle:** Develops into root system.
        *   **Plumule:** Develops into shoot system.

---

### 2. Structure of a Monocot Seed (Example: Maize Grain)

*   Type of fruit: **caryopsis** (fruit wall fused with seed coat).
*   Endospermic seed (has food-storing endosperm).
*   **Seed Coat and Fruit Wall:** Single protective layer.
*   **Endosperm:** Bulky, food-storing tissue (rich in starch).
*   **Aleurone Layer:** Protein-rich layer around endosperm.
*   **Embryo:** Small, in groove.
    *   **Scutellum (1 Cotyledon):** Shield-shaped, digests/absorbs food from endosperm.
    *   **Embryonic Axis:**
        *   **Plumule:** Protected by **coleoptile**.
        *   **Radicle:** Protected by **coleorhiza**.

### Differences between Dicot and Monocot Seeds

| Feature | Dicot Seed (Bean) | Monocot Seed (Maize) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cotyledons** | Two cotyledons. | One cotyledon (scutellum). |
| **Endosperm** | Absent in mature seed (non-endospermic). | Present in mature seed (endospermic). |
| **Food Storage** | Food is stored in the cotyledons. | Food is stored in the endosperm. |
| **Embryo Size** | Embryo is large. | Embryo is small. |
| **Protective Sheaths** | Coleoptile and coleorhiza are absent. | Plumule by coleoptile; radicle by coleorhiza. |

## Seed Germination

*   Process by which dormant embryo resumes growth and develops into a seedling.

---

### Types of Germination

1.  **Epigeal Germination (e.g., Bean Seed):**
    *   **Hypocotyl** elongates rapidly, pushes cotyledons **above ground**.
    *   Cotyledons may become photosynthetic.
2.  **Hypogeal Germination (e.g., Maize Grain, Pea Seed):**
    *   **Epicotyl** elongates.
    *   Cotyledons **remain below ground**, provide nourishment.

---

### Differences between Epigeal and Hypogeal Germination

| Feature | Epigeal Germination (Bean) | Hypogeal Germination (Maize/Pea) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fate of Cotyledons** | Pushed above the soil. | Remain below the soil. |
| **Function of Cotyledons** | May become first photosynthetic leaves. | Solely provide nutrition; never photosynthesize. |
| **Elongating Part** | The hypocotyl elongates. | The epicotyl elongates. |

## Conditions for Seed Germination

*   Requires favorable external conditions.

---

### Conditions for Seed Germination

1.  **Water (Moisture):**
    *   Softens seed coat, activates enzymes, breaks down stored food.
    *   **Experiment:** Seeds with moist cotton wool germinate; dry do not.
2.  **Oxygen (Air):**
    *   Needed for aerobic respiration to release energy for embryo growth.
    *   **Experiment (Three Bean Seed):** Only seed with both water and oxygen germinates.
3.  **Suitable Temperature (Warmth):**
    *   Enzyme-driven process, requires optimum temperature (25°C-35°C).
    *   **Experiment:** Seeds at room temp germinate; in refrigerator do not.
