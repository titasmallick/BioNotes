# Animal Tissues

## Epithelial Tissue

*   **Location:** Covers the body surface, lines internal organs and cavities.
*   **Function:** Protection, secretion, absorption, and filtration.

## Connective Tissue

*   **Bone:**
    *   **Location:** Forms the skeleton of the body.
    *   **Function:** Provides support, protection, and helps in movement.
*   **Cartilage:**
    *   **Location:** Found in the nose, ear, trachea, and at the ends of bones.
    *   **Function:** Provides support and flexibility, and reduces friction at joints.
*   **Blood:**
    *   **Location:** Circulates throughout the body within blood vessels.
    *   **Function:** Transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products.
*   **Ligament:**
    *   **Location:** Connects bones to bones at joints.
    *   **Function:** Provides stability to joints.
*   **Tendon:**
    *   **Location:** Connects muscles to bones.
    *   **Function:** Transmits force from muscles to bones, enabling movement.

## Muscular Tissue

*   **Striated (Voluntary or Skeletal Muscle):**
    *   **Location:** Attached to bones.
    *   **Function:** Responsible for voluntary movements of the body.
*   **Unstriated (Involuntary/Smooth Muscle):**
    *   **Location:** Found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels.
    *   **Function:** Responsible for involuntary movements, such as digestion and blood flow.
*   **Cardiac (Specialized Muscle):**
    *   **Location:** Found only in the heart.
    *   **Function:** Responsible for the rhythmic contractions of the heart, pumping blood throughout the body.

## Nerve Tissue

*   **Parts of Neuron:**
    *   **Cell Body (Soma):** Contains the nucleus and other organelles.
    *   **Dendron (Dendrite):** Short, branched extensions that receive nerve impulses from other neurons.
    *   **Axon:** A long, slender projection that transmits nerve impulses away from the cell body to other neurons or effector cells.
