# Kingdom Classification - Plantae

## Characteristics

*   **Multicellular:** Organisms in this kingdom are composed of many cells.
*   **Eukaryotic:** They possess a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Autotrophic:** They produce their own food through photosynthesis, using chlorophyll.
*   **Cell Wall:** Possess rigid cell walls primarily made of cellulose.
*   **Reproduction:** Primarily reproduce sexually, but many also exhibit asexual reproduction.
*   **Habitat:** Mostly terrestrial, but some are aquatic.

## Examples

*   **Algae:** Simple aquatic plants (e.g., Spirogyra, Chlamydomonas).
*   **Mosses:** Non-vascular plants (e.g., Funaria).
*   **Ferns:** Vascular plants that reproduce by spores (e.g., Dryopteris).
*   **Flowering Plants:** The most diverse group of plants, reproducing by seeds enclosed within fruits (e.g., Rose, Mango, Wheat).
*   **Conifers:** Cone-bearing plants (e.g., Pine, Fir).
