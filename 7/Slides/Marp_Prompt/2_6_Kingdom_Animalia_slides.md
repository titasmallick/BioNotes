# Kingdom Classification - Animalia

---

## Characteristics

*   **Multicellular:** Organisms in this kingdom are composed of many cells.
*   **Eukaryotic:** They possess a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Heterotrophic:** They obtain nutrients by ingesting other organisms or organic matter.
*   **No Cell Wall:** Animal cells do not have a cell wall.
*   **Motility:** Most animals are capable of locomotion.
*   **Reproduction:** Primarily reproduce sexually.

## (a) Vertebrates

*   Animals that possess a backbone or spinal column.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Presence of a vertebral column.
    *   Well-developed internal skeleton.
    *   Complex nervous system with a brain enclosed in a cranium.
    *   Bilateral symmetry.
    *   Closed circulatory system.
*   **Examples:** Fish, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, Mammals.

## (b) Invertebrates

*   Animals that do not possess a backbone or spinal column.
*   Constitute the vast majority of animal species.

### 9 Major Phyla (Invertebrates)

1.  **Porifera (Sponges):** Simplest multicellular, sessile, porous body, filter feeders.
2.  **Cnidaria (Coelenterata):** Radial symmetry, stinging cells, sac-like body.
3.  **Platyhelminthes (Flatworms):** Dorsoventrally flattened, bilateral symmetry, acoelomate.
4.  **Nematoda (Roundworms):** Cylindrical, unsegmented, pseudocoelomate, many parasitic.
5.  **Annelida (Segmented Worms):** Segmented body, true coelom, well-developed organ systems.
6.  **Arthropoda:** Jointed legs, chitinous exoskeleton, segmented body, most diverse.
7.  **Mollusca:** Soft body, usually shelled, muscular foot, mantle.
8.  **Echinodermata:** Spiny skin, radial symmetry (adults), water vascular system.
