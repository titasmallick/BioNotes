# Allergy

## Concept of Allergy

*   Exaggerated or abnormal immune response by the body to a normally harmless substance (allergen).
*   Immune system mistakenly identifies allergen as a threat, produces antibodies.

---

## Allergens

*   Substances that can trigger an allergic reaction.
*   **Examples:** Dust (dust mites), pollen grain, mites, strong sunlight (in sensitive individuals), particular food items (peanuts, milk, eggs, etc.).

---

## Entry Routes of Allergens

*   **Mouth:** Ingestion of allergic food items.
*   **Nose:** Inhalation of airborne allergens (pollen, dust, pet dander).
*   **Skin:** Direct contact (certain plants, chemicals, insect stings).

*   **Respiratory:** Sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy nose, watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath.
*   **Skin:** Rashes, hives (urticaria), itching, eczema.
*   **Digestive:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
*   **Systemic (severe cases):** Swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing, drop in blood pressure, dizziness, loss of consciousness (anaphylaxis).
