# Kingdom Classification - Protista

---

## Characteristics

*   **Unicellular:** Most organisms in this kingdom are single-celled.
*   **Eukaryotic:** They possess a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Nutrition:** Can be autotrophic (photosynthetic), heterotrophic (ingestive or absorptive), or mixotrophic.
*   **Locomotion:** May have flagella, cilia, or pseudopods for movement.
*   **Habitat:** Primarily aquatic, found in freshwater, saltwater, and moist terrestrial environments.

## Amoeba

*   Common example of a protist, known for its changing shape.

---

### Basic Structure (Amoeba)

*   **Irregular Shape:** Lacks fixed shape, constantly changing due to pseudopods.
*   **Cell Membrane:** The outer boundary that encloses the cytoplasm.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Divided into two parts:
    *   **Ectoplasm:** The clear, outer, non-granular layer.
    *   **Endoplasm:** The inner, granular, more fluid layer containing organelles.
*   **Nucleus:** A single, large, dense, and usually spherical structure that controls cell activities.
*   **Contractile Vacuole:** Regulates water balance (osmoregulation) by expelling excess water.
*   **Food Vacuoles:** Formed during feeding, containing ingested food particles.

### Life Processes (Amoeba)

*   **Nutrition (Holozoic):**
    1.  **Ingestion:** Amoeba engulfs food particles (e.g., bacteria, algae) using pseudopods, forming a food cup that becomes a food vacuole.
    2.  **Digestion:** Lysosomes containing digestive enzymes fuse with the food vacuole, breaking down complex food into simpler substances.
    3.  **Absorption:** Digested food diffuses into the cytoplasm.
    4.  **Assimilation:** Absorbed food is utilized for energy, growth, and repair.
    5.  **Egestion:** Undigested waste is expelled from the cell at any point on the surface.
*   **Locomotion:** Moves by **pseudopods** (false feet).
*   **Respiration:** Occurs through the general body surface (diffusion of O₂ in, CO₂ out).
*   **Excretion:** Waste products (e.g., ammonia) are removed by diffusion through the cell membrane. Contractile vacuole expels excess water.
*   **Reproduction:**
    *   **Binary Fission:** Under favorable conditions, divides into two identical daughter Amoebae.
    *   **Multiple Fission (Encystment):** Under unfavorable conditions, forms a protective cyst, divides repeatedly inside, releases many small Amoebae when conditions return.
