# Kingdom Classification - Monera

---

## Characteristics

*   **Unicellular:** Organisms in this kingdom are single-celled.
*   **Prokaryotic:** They lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Cell Wall:** Most have a cell wall, but it is not made of cellulose.
*   **Nutrition:** Can be autotrophic (photosynthetic or chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic.
*   **Reproduction:** Primarily by binary fission.

---

## Bacteria

*   **Shape:** Bacteria can have various shapes:
    *   **Cocci:** Spherical (e.g., Streptococcus)
    *   **Bacilli:** Rod-shaped (e.g., Lactobacillus)
    *   **Spirilla:** Spiral-shaped (e.g., Spirillum)
    *   **Vibrio:** Comma-shaped (e.g., Vibrio cholerae)

---

### Useful Bacteria (Applications related to daily life)

*   **Food Production:** Used in making yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, and vinegar.
*   **Medicine:** Used to produce antibiotics (e.g., Streptomycin) and vaccines.
*   **Agriculture:** Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium) convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants, enriching soil fertility.
*   **Decomposition:** Decomposers break down dead organic matter, recycling nutrients in the ecosystem.
*   **Bioremediation:** Used to clean up oil spills and other pollutants.

### Harmful Bacteria (Applications related to daily life)

*   **Diseases:** Cause various diseases in humans (e.g., Cholera, Tuberculosis, Typhoid), animals, and plants.
*   **Food Spoilage:** Cause food to rot and become unfit for consumption.
*   **Denitrification:** Some bacteria convert nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen, reducing soil fertility.
