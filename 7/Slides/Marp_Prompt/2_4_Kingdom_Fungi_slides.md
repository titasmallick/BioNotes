# Kingdom Classification - Fungi

---

## Characteristics

*   **Eukaryotic:** Possess a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Heterotrophic:** Obtain nutrients by absorbing dissolved organic molecules from their environment (saprophytic or parasitic).
*   **Cell Wall:** Have cell walls made of chitin.
*   **Reproduction:** Reproduce by spores, budding, or fragmentation.
*   **Structure:** Most are multicellular, composed of filamentous structures called hyphae, which collectively form a mycelium. Yeasts are unicellular fungi.

---

## Basic Structure of Mould

*   **Hyphae:** Thread-like structures forming the fungal body.
*   **Mycelium:** Entire mass of hyphae.
*   **Sporangiophores:** Specialized hyphae bearing sporangia.
*   **Sporangium:** Sac-like structure containing spores.
*   **Spores:** Reproductive units, germinate to form new hyphae.

## Nutrition in Mould

*   **Heterotrophic** and primarily **saprophytic**.
*   Obtain nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter.
*   Secrete digestive enzymes externally, then absorb simpler molecules.

---

## Respiration in Mould

*   Can perform both **aerobic** and **anaerobic respiration**.
*   **Aerobic:** In presence of oxygen, complete glucose breakdown, large ATP.
*   **Anaerobic (Fermentation):** In absence of oxygen, incomplete glucose breakdown, small ATP (e.g., alcohol in yeast).

## Useful Fungi (Applications related to daily life)

*   **Food Production:**
    *   **Yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*):** Baking (leavening), brewing (alcohol).
    *   **Mushrooms:** Edible food source (umami, nutrients).
    *   **Cheese Production:** Specific fungi ripen and flavor cheeses (e.g., Roquefort, Camembert).
*   **Medicine:**
    *   **Antibiotics:** Penicillin (from *Penicillium chrysogenum*).
    *   **Immunosuppressants:** Cyclosporine.
*   **Decomposition:** Crucial decomposers, recycle nutrients.

## Harmful Fungi (Applications related to daily life)

*   **Diseases:**
    *   **In Plants:** Crop loss (rusts, smuts, blights).
    *   **In Humans:** Skin infections (ringworm, athlete's foot), candidiasis, respiratory infections.
*   **Food Spoilage:** Spoil food items, economic losses, health risks (e.g., aflatoxins from *Aspergillus*).
*   **Damage to Materials:** Grow on and damage wood, textiles, etc.
