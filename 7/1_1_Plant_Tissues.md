# Plant Tissues

## Definition of Tissue

A tissue is a group of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function.

## Classification of Plant Tissues

Plant tissues are broadly classified into:

1.  **Meristematic Tissues:** Tissues with actively dividing cells, responsible for growth.
2.  **Permanent Tissues:** Tissues composed of cells that have lost the ability to divide and have taken on a permanent shape, size, and function. These are further divided into Simple and Complex permanent tissues.

### Meristematic Tissues

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Cells are small, isodiametric, and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces.
    *   Cells have dense cytoplasm, a large nucleus, and thin cell walls.
    *   They are actively dividing cells.
*   **Location:** Found in the growing regions of the plant, such as root tips, shoot tips, and cambium.
*   **Function:** Responsible for the growth of the plant in length and girth.
*   **Examples:** Apical meristem, Lateral meristem, Intercalary meristem.

### Simple Permanent Tissues

These tissues are made up of only one type of cell.

*   **Parenchyma:**
    *   **Structure:** Thin-walled, isodiametric cells with large central vacuoles and intercellular spaces.
    *   **Location:** Found in the cortex, pith, and mesophyll of leaves.
    *   **Functions:** Storage of food, photosynthesis (chlorenchyma), and providing turgidity to the plant.
*   **Collenchyma:**
    *   **Structure:** Elongated cells with unevenly thickened cell walls, especially at the corners.
    *   **Location:** Found in the leaf stalks, below the epidermis of young stems.
    *   **Functions:** Provides mechanical support and flexibility to young stems and petioles.
*   **Sclerenchyma:**
    *   **Structure:** Long, narrow cells with thick, lignified cell walls. They are dead cells.
    *   **Location:** Found in stems, around vascular bundles, in veins of leaves, and hard coverings of seeds and nuts.
    *   **Functions:** Provides mechanical strength and rigidity to the plant.

### Complex Permanent Tissues

These tissues are made up of more than one type of cell, working together as a unit.

*   **Xylem:**
    *   **Function:** Responsible for the transport of water and minerals from the roots to other parts of the plant.
*   **Phloem:**
    *   **Function:** Responsible for the transport of food (sugars) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
