# Excretory System - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Person in desert with limited water, concentrated yellow urine.
1. Identify the hormone.
   - **Answer:** ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone) or Vasopressin.
2. Target site of the hormone.
   - **Answer:** Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT) and Collecting Duct.
3. **Designing:** Predict change after drinking water.
   - **Answer:** Urine will become dilute (hypotonic) and large in volume as ADH secretion decreases.
4. **Analysis:** Osmoregulation.
   - **Answer:** The process of maintaining the constant osmotic pressure/water-salt balance of the blood.
5. Why yellow?
   - **Answer:** Presence of Urochrome, a pigment formed from the breakdown of hemoglobin.

**Case Study 2:**
Patient undergoing Haemodialysis.
6. Principle of dialysis.
   - **Answer:** Diffusion/Osmosis across a semi-permeable (cellophane) membrane.
7. Why compose fluid like plasma without waste?
   - **Answer:** To create a concentration gradient so nitrogenous wastes (Urea) move from blood to fluid, while essential nutrients remain in the blood.
8. **Creating:** Dialysis diagram.
   - **Answer:** [Description: Blood pumped from artery through tubes in a tank of dialysing fluid, then returned to a vein].
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why not a permanent cure?
   - **Answer:** It only filters waste; it cannot perform other kidney functions like hormone production (Erythropoietin) or active regulation. Kidney transplant is the permanent solution.
10. Survive with one kidney?
    - **Answer:** Yes. The remaining kidney undergoes compensatory hypertrophy (increases in size and function) to handle the load.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Efferent arteriole is narrower than afferent.
    **Reason (R):** Creates high hydrostatic pressure for ultrafiltration.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Glucose is not in normal urine.
    **Reason (R):** It is completely reabsorbed in PCT.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
13. **Assertion (A):** Urine is slightly acidic.
    **Reason (R):** Secretion of H+ ions into filtrate.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
14. **Assertion (A):** Liver is an excretory organ.
    **Reason (R):** It produces urea.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
15. **Assertion (A):** Alcohol leads to frequent urination.
    **Reason (R):** Alcohol inhibits ADH.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Steps of urine formation flowchart.
    - **Answer:** Glomerulus (Ultrafiltration) -> PCT/Henle/DCT (Selective Reabsorption) -> DCT/Collecting Duct (Tubular Secretion) -> Urine.
17. **Creating:** Nephron Map.
    - **Answer:** [PCT: Glucose, Amino acids, 65% water. Loop of Henle: Water (descending), Salts (ascending). DCT: Salts and Water (facultative)].
18. **Analysis:** Filtrate vs Urine.
    - **Answer:** Filtrate contains glucose/amino acids; urine does not. Proteins are absent in both because they are too large to pass the glomerular filter.
19. **Designing:** Table of waste products.
    - **Answer:** [Urea: Protein metabolism. Uric acid: Nucleic acid metabolism. Creatinine: Muscle metabolism].
20. **Visualisation:** Malpighian Body diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Cup-like Bowman's capsule surrounding a tuft of capillaries].
21. **Application:** Drink water in summer.
    - **Answer:** To compensate for water lost through sweating (thermoregulation) and prevent dehydration/concentrated urine.
22. **Creating:** Glomerulus mimic.
    - **Answer:** A high-pressure pump pushing liquid through an ultra-fine mesh filter.
23. **Analysis:** Threshold Substance.
    - **Answer:** A substance reabsorbed efficiently by the kidney. Glucose is "high-threshold" because it's only excreted if its blood level exceeds a certain limit (Renal threshold).
24. **Designing:** Kidney stone diet.
    - **Answer:** Avoid spinach, tomatoes, and nuts (high in oxalates). Increase water intake.
25. **Creating:** Kidney-Brain dialogue.
    - **Answer:** Kidney: "Hey Brain, the blood is too salty!" Brain: "Copy that, releasing ADH now. Hold onto that water!"

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Ultrafiltration.
    - **Answer:** Filtration under high pressure where almost all liquid components (except proteins/cells) are forced out.
27. **Scenario:** Blood in urine (Haematuria).
    - **Answer:** Possible kidney stone or infection causing damage to the urinary tract lining.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Ammonia vs Urea.
    - **Answer:** Ammonia is highly toxic and needs lots of water to flush; suitable for fish. Urea is less toxic and conserves water; suitable for land mammals.
29. **Application:** Gout.
    - **Answer:** Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of Uric acid crystals.
30. Excretion vs Egestion.
    - **Answer:** Excretion: Removal of metabolic waste from cells. Egestion: Removal of undigested food from the gut.
31. **Diagram Based:** Urinary system.
    - **Answer:** Sphincter muscles control the release of urine from the bladder (voluntary control).
32. Skin in excretion.
    - **Answer:** Sweat glands remove water, salts, and small amounts of urea.
33. **Analysis:** Right kidney lower.
    - **Answer:** Due to the large space occupied by the liver on the right side.
34. **Competency:** Counter-current mechanism.
    - **Answer:** The flow of filtrate in opposite directions in the two limbs of the Loop of Henle helps build an osmotic gradient in the medulla to concentrate urine.
35. **Case:** High protein effect.
    - **Answer:** More protein -> More deamination in liver -> More Urea in blood -> More Urea in urine.
36. **Creating:** Caffeine hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Caffeine increases blood flow to kidneys and inhibits ADH, increasing urine output.
37. **Designing:** Deamination visual.
    - **Answer:** Amino Acid -> Ammonia ($NH_3$) -> Ornithine Cycle -> Urea.
38. **Application:** pH maintenance.
    - **Answer:** Kidneys secrete H+ ions and reabsorb $HCO_3^-$ ions to keep blood pH constant (approx 7.4).
39. **Critical Thinking:** Is urine sterile?
    - **Answer:** Yes, inside a healthy bladder, but it picks up bacteria as it exits the body.
40. **Analysis:** Micturition.
    - **Answer:** The act of passing urine. It is a reflex initiated by stretch receptors, but controllable by the brain.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Diabetes Insipidus.
    - **Answer:** Deficiency of ADH. Different from Mellitus (Insulin deficiency/Sugar). "Insipidus" means tasteless urine.
42. **Designing:** Model.
    - **Answer:** Funnel (Capsule), Plastic tube (Nephron), Bottle (Bladder).
43. **Application:** Shivering while urinating in cold.
    - **Answer:** Emptying a warm bladder causes a sudden drop in core temperature; shivering generates heat to compensate.
44. **Creating:** Crossword.
    - **Answer:** [Terms: Cortex (Outer), Medulla (Inner), Hilum (Notch)].
45. **Case Study:** Hydronephrosis.
    - **Answer:** Back-pressure of urine causes the kidney to swell and tissue to atrophy.
46. JGA role.
    - **Answer:** Detects low BP and releases Renin, which leads to vasoconstriction and salt/water retention to raise BP.
47. **Critical Thinking:** Longer Loop of Henle.
    - **Answer:** Allows for greater water reabsorption, producing highly concentrated urine for water conservation.
48. **Analysis:** Cortical vs Juxtamedullary.
    - **Answer:** Cortical: Loop of Henle is short. Juxtamedullary: Loop of Henle is long and deep in medulla (for concentrating urine).
49. **Designing:** Urea concentration graph.
    - **Answer:** High in Renal Artery, significantly lower in Renal Vein.
50. **Creating:** Smart Toilet parameters.
    - **Answer:** Protein (Kidney health), Glucose (Diabetes), pH, Specific Gravity (Hydration).
