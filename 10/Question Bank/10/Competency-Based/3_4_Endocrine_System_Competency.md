# Endocrine System - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Child with Cretinism (stunted growth, mental retardation).
1. Which gland?
   - **Answer:** Thyroid gland.
2. Name hormone and function.
   - **Answer:** Thyroxine. It regulates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), growth, and development.
3. **Designing:** Dietary inclusion.
   - **Answer:** Iodised salt.
4. **Analysis:** Cretinism vs Dwarfism.
   - **Answer:** Cretinism is due to Thyroid deficiency and involves mental retardation. Pituitary Dwarfism is due to Growth Hormone deficiency and the individual is mentally normal.
5. Adult hyposecretion condition.
   - **Answer:** Myxoedema (Sluggishness, swelling of face/hands).

**Case Study 2:**
Surge of energy when chased by a dog.
6. Identify hormone.
   - **Answer:** Adrenaline (or Epinephrine).
7. Why "Fight or Flight"?
   - **Answer:** It prepares the body for sudden physical action to either face the threat or run away.
8. **Creating:** Flowchart.
   - **Answer:** Adrenaline -> Heart (Rate up) -> Lungs (Breathing up) -> Liver (Glycogen to Glucose) -> Muscles (Blood supply up).
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why digestive system slows?
   - **Answer:** To divert blood flow and energy away from non-essential tasks to the heart and skeletal muscles.
10. Which gland and location?
    - **Answer:** Adrenal glands. Located as "caps" on top of each kidney.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Pancreas is heterocrine.
    **Reason (R):** It has both exocrine and endocrine parts.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Insulin lowers blood sugar.
    **Reason (R):** It promotes Glycogenesis.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

    **Reason (R):** It controls other glands.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
14. **Assertion (A):** Simple Goitre caused by Iron deficiency.
    **Reason (R):** Iron is essential for Thyroxine.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true (in structure, but factually both are false as Iodine is needed). Correct: (d) A is false. (Iodine is needed).
15. **Assertion (A):** Diabetes Mellitus has Glycosuria.
    **Reason (R):** Caused by hyposecretion of Insulin.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Negative Feedback diagram.
    - **Answer:** Low Thyroxine -> Hypothalamus releases TRH -> Pituitary releases TSH -> Thyroid releases Thyroxine -> High Thyroxine inhibits TRH/TSH.
17. **Creating:** Insulin Profile Card.
    - **Answer:** Source: Beta cells. Target: Liver/Muscles. Function: Lowers sugar. Deficiency: Diabetes Mellitus.
18. **Analysis:** Exophthalmic vs Simple Goitre.
    - **Answer:** Exophthalmic: Hyperthyroidism, protruding eyes, weight loss. Simple: Hypothyroidism, iodine deficiency, swelling in neck.
19. **Designing:** Anterior Pituitary table.
    - **Answer:** [GH: Growth. TSH: Stimulates Thyroid. ACTH: Stimulates Adrenal cortex. FSH/LH: Gonad function].
20. **Visualisation:** Gland locations.
    - **Answer:** [Thyroid: Neck. Pancreas: Below stomach. Adrenal: Above kidneys].
21. **Application:** Thirst and hunger in diabetes.
    - **Answer:** Sugar in urine pulls water (thirst). Cells are starving for glucose because it can't enter without insulin (hunger).
22. **Creating:** Feedback failure scenario.
    - **Answer:** Thyroid would keep growing (forming a huge goitre) and metabolism would skyrocket to dangerous levels.
23. **Analysis:** Insulin vs Glucagon.
    - **Answer:** Insulin lowers blood sugar (store as glycogen). Glucagon raises blood sugar (break down glycogen).
24. **Designing:** IDD poster.
    - **Answer:** [Visuals of Goitre and Cretinism, promoting Iodised salt].
25. **Creating:** Cortisone explanation.
    - **Answer:** It mimics cortisol, which suppresses the immune system and reduces inflammation in joints/tissues.

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Tropic Hormones.
    - **Answer:** Hormones that stimulate other endocrine glands to secrete their hormones (e.g., TSH, ACTH).
27. **Scenario:** Giant vs Dwarf.
    - **Answer:** Giant: Hypersecretion of GH in childhood. Dwarf: Hyposecretion of GH in childhood.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Adrenal Medulla and Sympathetic system.
    - **Answer:** Both work together to produce the stress response. The Medulla is essentially a specialized part of the sympathetic system.
29. **Application:** Acromegaly.
    - **Answer:** Hypersecretion of GH in adults, leading to thickened bones in hands, feet, and face.
30. Diabetes Mellitus vs Insipidus.
    - **Answer:** Mellitus: Sugar problem (Insulin). Insipidus: Water problem (ADH).
31. **Diagram Based:** Islets of Langerhans.
    - **Answer:** Alpha: Glucagon. Beta: Insulin.
32. Oxytocin and Prolactin.
    - **Answer:** Oxytocin: Uterine contraction and milk ejection. Prolactin: Milk production.
33. **Analysis:** Thymus gland changes.
    - **Answer:** It is involved in T-lymphocyte maturation for immunity; its shrinkage contributes to weaker immunity in the elderly.
34. **Competency:** Adrenaline on liver.
    - **Answer:** Stimulates Glycogenolysis (Glycogen to Glucose) to provide immediate energy.
35. **Case:** Graves' disease.
    - **Answer:** Hyperthyroidism.
36. **Creating:** Cortisol hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Chronic high cortisol suppresses the immune system and increases blood pressure/sugar.
37. **Designing:** Endocrine vs Exocrine visual.
    - **Answer:** Endocrine: No ducts, secretes to blood. Exocrine: Has ducts, secretes to surface/organ.
38. **Application:** Birth control pills.
    - **Answer:** Contain estrogen/progesterone which inhibit FSH/LH, preventing ovulation.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Why insulin injection?
    - **Answer:** Insulin is a protein; if taken as a pill, it would be digested by stomach enzymes and become inactive.
40. **Analysis:** Chemical Messengers.
    - **Answer:** Hormones produced in small quantities, transported by blood, acting on distant target organs.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

    - **Answer:** Hypothalamus (Releasing factors) -> Pituitary (Tropic hormones) -> Glands (Final hormones).
43. **Application:** Addison's Disease.

46. Gastrin and Secretin.
    - **Answer:** Local hormones in the gut that regulate digestive secretions.
47. **Critical Thinking:** "Dual Organ".
    - **Answer:** Refers to the Pancreas having both digestive (exocrine) and hormonal (endocrine) functions.
48. **Analysis:** Adrenaline vs Noradrenaline.
