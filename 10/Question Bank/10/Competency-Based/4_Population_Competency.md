## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Survey form.
    - **Answer:** [Fields: Name, Age, Number of children, Occupation, Awareness of family planning].
17. **Creating:** Bar graph data.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Steady climb from 360 million in 1951 to over 1.2 billion in 2011].
18. **Analysis:** Natality vs Mortality.
    - **Answer:** Natality: Birth rate. Mortality: Death rate. Population grows if Natality > Mortality.
19. **Designing:** Contraceptive table.
    - **Answer:** [Barrier: Condom (blocks sperm). Hormonal: Pill (stops ovulation). IUD: Copper-T (prevents implantation). Surgical: Vasectomy (blocks sperm transport)].
20. **Visualisation:** Red Triangle.
    - **Answer:** Symbol for family planning/welfare services in India.
21. **Application:** Legal marriage age.
    - **Answer:** To ensure physical/mental maturity and to reduce the total reproductive span of a couple.
22. **Creating:** Government strategy.
    - **Answer:** Financial incentives for sterilization after two children, free education for the first child.
23. **Analysis:** Population and Pollution.
    - **Answer:** More people -> More consumption -> More waste generation and resource depletion.
24. **Designing:** Skit script.

25. **Creating:** Sex education letter.
    - **Answer:** [Arguments for scientific knowledge to prevent STDs, unwanted pregnancies, and myths].

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Demography.
    - **Answer:** The statistical study of human populations (size, density, distribution, and vital statistics).
27. **Scenario:** Equal birth and death rates.
    - **Answer:** Zero Population Growth (ZPG). The population remains stable.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Malthusian theory.
    - **Answer:** Population grows geometrically (2,4,8...) while food grows arithmetically (1,2,3...). Leads to "Malthusian catastrophe" (famine/war).
29. **Application:** IUD (Copper-T).
    - **Answer:** Inserted into the uterus by a doctor; releases copper ions that suppress sperm motility and prevent implantation.
30. Immigration vs Emigration.
    - **Answer:** Immigration: People coming in. Emigration: People leaving.
31. **Diagram Based:** Age Pyramids.
    - **Answer:** Expanding (triangular) pyramid represents developing nations with high birth rates.
32. "Son Preference" role.
    - **Answer:** Couples may continue to have children until they have a boy, leading to larger family sizes.
33. **Analysis:** Low Sex Ratio.
    - **Answer:** Caused by social bias, female foeticide (selective abortion), and neglect of female children.
34. **Competency:** Oral Contraceptive mechanism.
    - **Answer:** High levels of estrogen/progesterone suppress FSH and LH secretion from the pituitary, preventing the follicles from maturing (no ovulation).
35. **Case:** Factory migration.
    - **Answer:** No, it is growth due to "Pull factors" of migration, not natural increase.
36. **Creating:** Demographic Transition.
