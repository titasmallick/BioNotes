# Human Evolution - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Fossil skull with small brain and prominent brow ridge (*Homo erectus*).
1. What does "Homo erectus" mean?
   - **Answer:** "Upright man" (referring to fully bipedal gait).
2. Cranial capacity comparison.
   - **Answer:** *Homo erectus*: 800-1100 cc. Modern man (*Homo sapiens*): Approx 1450 cc.
3. **Designing:** Timeline.
   - **Answer:** *Homo habilis* -> *Homo erectus* -> *Homo neanderthalensis* -> *Homo sapiens*.
4. **Analysis:** Significance of bipedalism.
   - **Answer:** Freed the hands for tool use/carrying, allowed for a higher line of sight, and was more energy-efficient for long-distance travel.
5. Did they use tools?
   - **Answer:** Yes, they made sophisticated stone tools like hand axes (Acheulean tools) and were the first to use fire.

**Case Study 2:**
Lamarck vs Darwin on giraffe's neck.
6. Lamarck's view.
   - **Answer:** "Acquired Character". He believed the neck stretched during the organism's life and this change was passed to offspring.
7. Darwin's view.
   - **Answer:** Natural Selection. Giraffes with naturally longer necks survived drought better (as they could reach leaves) and reproduced more.
8. **Creating:** Comic strip.
   - **Answer:** [Darwin: "Only the long-necked ones survived." Lamarck: "They just kept stretching until they grew."]
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why Lamarck rejected?
   - **Answer:** Experiments showed that changes in somatic cells (like cutting tails of mice) are not inherited; only changes in germ cells (DNA) are.
10. Example of non-inherited trait.
    - **Answer:** Pierced ears, scars, or knowledge/skills learned during a lifetime.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Cladogram.
    - **Answer:** [Fish -> Amphibian -> Reptile -> (Bird/Mammal)].
17. **Creating:** *Archaeopteryx* poster.
    - **Answer:** "Missing Link found. Has teeth and tail like a reptile, but feathers and wings like a bird."
18. **Analysis:** Homologous vs Analogous.
    - **Answer:** Homologous: Same origin, different function (Common ancestor). Analogous: Different origin, same function (Environment/Convergent evolution).
19. **Designing:** *H. habilis* vs *H. sapiens* table.
    - **Answer:** [*H. habilis*: 650-800cc, "Handy man", first tool maker. *H. sapiens*: 1450cc, complex culture, agriculture].
20. **Visualisation:** Forelimbs.
    - **Answer:** [Sketch showing pentadactyl limb pattern across bat, whale, and human].
21. **Application:** "Goosebumps".
    - **Answer:** Arrector pili muscles contract to fluff up fur (trapping heat or looking bigger); since we lost our fur, the response is vestigial.
22. **Creating:** Neanderthal story.
    - **Answer:** [Focus on group hunting, use of fire for warmth, and caring for the injured].
23. **Analysis:** Opposable Thumb.
    - **Answer:** Allowed for a "precision grip," enabling humans to make and use fine tools and eventually write.
24. **Designing:** CC Quiz.
    - **Answer:** [650-800: H. habilis. 900: H. erectus. 1450: H. sapiens].
25. **Creating:** Survival of Fittest for kids.
    - **Answer:** "Nature chooses the animals that have the best 'superpowers' for where they live."

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Speciation.
    - **Answer:** Formation of new species. Isolation prevents interbreeding; separate mutations and selection lead to different traits until they can no longer mate.
27. **Scenario:** Antibiotic resistance.
    - **Answer:** Some bacteria have a natural mutation for resistance. When antibiotics are used, only these "fit" ones survive and reproduce, creating a resistant population.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Are humans still evolving?
    - **Answer:** Yes (e.g., lactose tolerance, wisdom teeth disappearing), but cultural/medical evolution is now faster than biological evolution.
29. **Application:** Carbon Dating.
    - **Answer:** Measures the decay of Carbon-14 in organic fossils to determine their age (up to 50,000 years).
30. Ontogeny vs Phylogeny.
    - **Answer:** Ontogeny: Development of an individual embryo. Phylogeny: Evolutionary history of a species.
31. **Diagram Based:** Galapagos Finches.
    - **Answer:** Different beaks evolved from a common ancestor to exploit different food sources (seeds, insects, nectar) on different islands.
32. Role of Mutation.
    - **Answer:** It is the primary source of new genetic variations upon which natural selection acts.
33. **Analysis:** *Cro-Magnon*.
    - **Answer:** They were identical to modern humans in anatomy, had advanced art (cave paintings), and used complex bone/stone tools.
34. **Competency:** "Living Fossils".
    - **Answer:** Species that have remained largely unchanged for millions of years (e.g., King Crab).
35. **Case:** Mountain isolation.
    - **Answer:** Geographical isolation leads to reproductive isolation over time.
36. **Creating:** Dinosaur extinction hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** True; the mass extinction of dinosaurs cleared ecological niches, allowing small mammals to diversify and grow.
37. **Designing:** Vestigial visual aid.
    - **Answer:** [Sketch pointing to tailbone (Coccyx), wisdom teeth, and nictitating membrane (eye corner)].
38. **Application:** Embryology evidence.
    - **Answer:** Early embryos of fish, birds, and humans look almost identical, suggesting a common vertebrate ancestor.
39. **Critical Thinking:** "Out of Africa" theory.
    - **Answer:** Suggests all modern humans originated in Africa and migrated to other continents. Supported by DNA evidence.
40. **Analysis:** Gene Pool.
    - **Answer:** The total set of unique alleles in a population.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Artificial vs Natural Selection.
    - **Answer:** Artificial: Humans choose traits (fast). Natural: Environment chooses traits (slow).
42. **Designing:** Camouflage model.
    - **Answer:** Use green and brown colored buttons on a green lawn; birds (students) will pick up more brown ones.
43. **Application:** Embryo gill slits.
    - **Answer:** Remnants of our aquatic ancestry; in humans, they develop into parts of the ear and throat.
44. **Creating:** Timeline.
    - **Answer:** [Cenozoic Era: Age of Mammals and Humans].
45. **Case Study:** Sickle Cell Heterozygote advantage.
    - **Answer:** People with one sickle-cell gene (carriers) are resistant to Malaria, so the gene stays in the population where malaria is common.
46. Genetic Drift.
    - **Answer:** Random changes in gene frequency in small populations (by chance, not selection).
47. **Critical Thinking:** Man from monkeys?
    - **Answer:** No, both evolved from a common ancestor that was neither a modern monkey nor a modern man.
48. **Analysis:** Ape vs Human jaw.
    - **Answer:** Ape: U-shaped, protruding (Prognathous). Human: Semi-circular, flatter (Orthognathous).
49. **Designing:** Brain size chart.
    - **Answer:** [Australopithecus (450) -> H. habilis (700) -> H. erectus (900) -> H. sapiens (1450)].
50. **Creating:** Future Human.
    - **Answer:** [E.g., Larger head, smaller jaw, longer fingers for typing, weaker muscles].
