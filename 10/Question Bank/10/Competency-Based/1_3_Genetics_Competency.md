# Genetics - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Gregor Mendel crossed a tall pea plant with a dwarf pea plant. F1 were all tall. F2 had both tall and dwarf.
1. Identify the dominant and recessive traits.
   - **Answer:** Dominant: Tall (T). Recessive: Dwarf (t).
2. Why did the dwarf trait disappear in F1 and reappear in F2?
   - **Answer:** It was masked by the dominant 'T' allele in F1 (Tt). It reappeared in F2 when two recessive alleles came together (tt).
3. **Designing:** F2 Punnett square and ratios.
   - **Answer:** (T, t) x (T, t) -> TT, Tt, Tt, tt. Phenotypic Ratio: 3 Tall : 1 Dwarf. Genotypic Ratio: 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt.
4. If Mendel chose Snapdragon (Incomplete dominance)?
   - **Answer:** F1 would have an intermediate phenotype (e.g., Pink if parents were Red and White).
5. Why choose the pea plant?
   - **Answer:** Short life cycle, many contrasting traits, easy to cross-pollinate, produces many offspring.

**Case Study 2:**
Husband is color-blind, Wife has normal vision (father was color-blind).
6. Is color blindness autosomal or sex-linked?
   - **Answer:** Sex-linked (X-linked) recessive.
7. Genotype of the wife.
   - **Answer:** $X^C X^c$ (Carrier). Since her father was color-blind ($X^c Y$), he must have passed the $X^c$ to her.
8. **Creating:** Pedigree chart.
   - **Answer:** [Description: Circle-Square connecting. Husband shaded, Wife half-shaded/dot].
9. **Analysis:** % chance son will be color-blind.
   - **Answer:** 50%. The son receives Y from father and either $X^C$ (Normal) or $X^c$ (Color-blind) from mother.
10. Why more common in males?
    - **Answer:** Males have only one X chromosome. A single recessive allele on the X chromosome is enough to cause the condition.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** A heterozygous individual expresses the dominant trait.
    **Reason (R):** The dominant allele masks the expression of the recessive allele.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** The Law of Independent Assortment holds true for all pairs of characters.
    **Reason (R):** Linked genes do not assort independently.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true. (Linked genes are an exception).
13. **Assertion (A):** Haemophilia is known as "Bleeder's disease".
    **Reason (R):** It is an X-linked recessive disorder where blood fails to clot.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
14. **Assertion (A):** Mutation is a sudden change in genes.
    **Reason (R):** Changes in gene structure can lead to variations.
    - **Answer:** (b) Both A and R are true but R doesn't explain the "sudden" nature.
15. **Assertion (A):** In humans, the father determines the sex of the child.
    **Reason (R):** The egg contains X, sperm can carry X or Y.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Dihybrid cross RRYY x rryy.
    - **Answer:** Gametes: RY and ry. F1: RrYy (Round-Yellow).
17. **Creating:** Genetic Profile Bbtt.
    - **Answer:** Genotype: Bb (Heterozygous), tt (Homozygous recessive). Phenotype: Brown eyes (Dominant B), Straight hair (Recessive t).
18. **Analysis:** 25 short, 75 tall. Can you tell TT from Tt?
    - **Answer:** No. Both TT and Tt look identical (Tall) due to dominance.
19. **Designing:** Law of Segregation flowchart.
    - **Answer:** Parent (Tt) -> Meiosis -> Gamete 1 (T) and Gamete 2 (t) separate.
20. **Visualisation:** Locus and Alleles.
    - **Answer:** [Diagram: Two bars. Same spot marked A on one and a on the other].
21. **Application:** Blood Group AB.
    - **Answer:** Co-dominance. Both $I^A$ and $I^B$ alleles are expressed equally.
22. **Creating:** Two sparkling cats have a non-sparkling kitten.
    - **Answer:** Parents must be heterozygous (Ss). Cross: Ss x Ss -> 25% ss (non-sparkling).
23. **Analysis:** "Criss-cross inheritance".
    - **Answer:** Father passes the trait to daughter (carrier), who passes it to her son.
24. **Designing:** Pedigree checklist.
    - **Answer:** 1. Do unaffected parents have an affected child? (Recessive). 2. Does every affected child have an affected parent? (Dominant).
25. **Creating:** Dialogue.
    - **Answer:** Dominant: "I'm in charge here!" Recessive: "Fine, I'll wait until I meet someone just like me."

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Genotype vs Genome.
    - **Answer:** Genotype: Genetic makeup of an individual for a specific trait. Genome: Total genetic material (all genes) of an organism.
27. **Scenario:** Test Cross.
    - **Answer:** Cross with 'tt'. If all offspring tall -> Parent is TT. If 50% tall, 50% dwarf -> Parent is Tt.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Two blue-eyed parents have a brown-eyed child?
    - **Answer:** Impossible if blue is recessive and brown is dominant.
29. **Application:** Sickle Cell Anemia.
    - **Answer:** Point mutation -> Valine instead of Glutamic acid -> Hb molecules clump -> RBCs become sickle-shaped.
30. Monogenic vs Polygenic.
    - **Answer:** Monogenic: Controlled by one gene (e.g., Pea height). Polygenic: Controlled by multiple genes (e.g., Human skin color).
31. **Diagram Based:** Punnett square fill-in.
    - **Answer:** (Standard 2x2 grid results).
32. Importance of Variation.
    - **Answer:** Helps species adapt to changing environments, reducing extinction risk.
33. **Analysis:** Why X-linked recessive rare in females?
    - **Answer:** Female needs two recessive alleles ($X^h X^h$), requiring an affected father and at least a carrier mother.
34. **Competency:** 9:3:3:1 ratio.
    - **Answer:** F2 Phenotypic ratio of a Dihybrid cross. 9 (both dominant), 3 (1st dom), 3 (2nd dom), 1 (both rec).
35. **Case:** Epigenetics.
    - **Answer:** Environment affects gene expression without changing the DNA sequence.
36. **Creating:** "Mendel and Linkage".
    - **Answer:** True. Linked genes do not separate, so he wouldn't have seen the independent combinations.
37. **Designing:** Mutation visual aid.
    - **Answer:** Normal: BEAST. Deletion: BEST. Substitution: FEAST. Duplication: BEEAST.
38. **Application:** DNA Fingerprinting.
    - **Answer:** Uses VNTRs (Variable Number Tandem Repeats) which are unique to individuals.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Blood group different from parents.
    - **Answer:** Parents A ($I^A i$) and B ($I^B i$) can produce O ($ii$) or AB ($I^A I^B$).
40. **Analysis:** "Law of Purity of Gametes".
    - **Answer:** Gametes receive only one allele for each trait during meiosis.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Pure line of white (recessive).
    - **Answer:** Just one generation. If the plant is white (tt), it is already pure.
42. **Designing:** Tongue Rolling study.
    - **Answer:** Survey classmates, tally "Rollers" vs "Non-rollers", use Punnett square to estimate gene frequencies.
43. **Application:** Genetic Counseling.
    - **Answer:** Advice for couples with family history of genetic disorders to understand risks.

46. Multiple Alleles (ABO).
    - **Answer:** Three alleles ($I^A, I^B, i$) exist in the population for one gene.
47. **Critical Thinking:** Inbreeding risk.
    - **Answer:** Increases the probability of harmful recessive alleles coming together in homozygous form.
48. **Analysis:** Y-linked vs X-linked.
    - **Answer:** Y-linked (Holandric) passes from father to all sons. X-linked can skip generations via females.
49. **Designing:** Table of disorders.
    - **Answer:** Haemophilia (X-linked rec, bleeding), Color-blindness (X-linked rec, vision), Thalassemia (Autosomal rec, anemia).
50. **Creating:** Mendel's conclusion.
    - **Answer:** "Heredity is governed by discrete factors that segregate, assort independently, and follow rules of dominance."
