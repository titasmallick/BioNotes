# Chemical Coordination in Plants - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Potted plant placed horizontally. Stem bends up, roots bend down.
1. Identify the tropic movements.
   - **Answer:** Stem: Negative Geotropism. Root: Positive Geotropism.
2. Explain role of Auxin in stem.
   - **Answer:** Auxin accumulates on the lower side due to gravity. In stems, higher auxin concentration stimulates growth, causing the lower side to grow faster and bend the stem upwards.
3. **Designing:** Clinostat.
   - **Answer:** Rotate the plant slowly. Gravity acts on all sides equally, so the plant grows straight.
4. **Analysis:** Stem vs Root auxin.
   - **Answer:** Stems have a higher optimal concentration for growth than roots. The same concentration that stimulates a stem inhibits a root.
5. Differential growth name.
   - **Answer:** Tropism.

**Case Study 2:**
Gardener wants flowers out of season and to kill weeds.
6. Hormone for flowering?
   - **Answer:** Gibberellins.
7. Synthetic hormone as weedicide?
   - **Answer:** 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid).
8. **Creating:** Schedule.
   - **Answer:** Apply 2,4-D in early spring to kill young weeds; apply Gibberellins when plant size is sufficient for flowering.
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why specific to broad-leaved?
   - **Answer:** Broad-leaved plants (dicots) have a higher absorption rate and different metabolic sensitivity to 2,4-D compared to narrow-leaved grasses (monocots).
10. Delay ripening?
    - **Answer:** Avoid Ethylene.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Decapitation promotes lateral growth.
    **Reason (R):** Apical dominance is caused by Auxins.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** ABA is "Stress Hormone".
    **Reason (R):** It stimulates closure of stomata.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
13. **Assertion (A):** Ethylene is unique.
    **Reason (R):** It is a gaseous hormone.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
14. **Assertion (A):** Roots show positive phototropism.
    **Reason (R):** Roots grow towards light.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true (in its definition, but roots actually show negative phototropism). Actually, A is false and R is false as a fact. Let's fix: (d) A is false. Roots are negatively phototropic.
15. **Assertion (A):** Thigmotropism in tendrils.
    **Reason (R):** It is response to touch.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Hydrotropism experiment.
    - **Answer:** Use a perforated container with moist sawdust; seeds germinate, and roots grow towards the moisture source despite gravity.
17. **Creating:** Mnemonic.
    - **Answer:** **A**ll **G**ood **C**ells **E**at **A**pples (Auxin, Gibberellin, Cytokinin, Ethylene, ABA).
18. **Analysis:** Tropic vs Nastic.
    - **Answer:** Tropic: Directional (growth-related). Nastic: Non-directional (usually turgor-related).
19. **Designing:** Cytokinins table.
    - **Answer:** [Promotes cell division, delays senescence, breaks seed dormancy, promotes lateral growth].
20. **Visualisation:** Phototropism diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Auxin on shaded side makes cells longer, bending shoot to light].
21. **Application:** Ripening bananas.
    - **Answer:** Ripe bananas release Ethylene gas, which speeds up ripening of other fruits.
22. **Creating:** Lacking Gibberellins.
    - **Answer:** The plant would be extremely short (dwarf) with very small internodes.
23. **Analysis:** Chemotropism in fertilization.
    - **Answer:** The pollen tube grows towards the chemicals (sugars) secreted by the synergids in the ovule.
24. **Designing:** "Bushy" rose.
    - **Answer:** Remove the apical buds (Pruning) to stop apical dominance and allow lateral buds to grow.
25. **Creating:** Mimosa story.
    - **Answer:** "A finger touched me! Quick, pull the water out of my leaf base (pulvinus) so I can fold up and hide."

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Parthenocarpy.
    - **Answer:** Development of fruit without fertilization. Induced by Auxins and Gibberellins.
27. **Scenario:** Transporting bananas.
    - **Answer:** Keep them in a cold, well-ventilated area with low Oxygen or use Ethylene absorbers (KMnO4).
28. **Critical Thinking:** Sunflower movement.
    - **Answer:** It is not a growth movement in the short term; it's due to turgor changes in the pulvinus-like region of the stem (Heliotropism).
29. **Application:** "Bolting".
    - **Answer:** Sudden elongation of internodes just before flowering, caused by Gibberellins.
30. Phototropism vs Photonasty.
    - **Answer:** Phototropism: Stem grows to light. Photonasty: Flower opens/closes depending on light intensity (regardless of direction).
31. **Diagram Based:** Tendril coiling.
    - **Answer:** Contact with support reduces auxin on the touch side, causing the outer side to grow faster and coil.
32. Ethylene effects.
    - **Answer:** Promotes abscission of leaves and flowers.
33. **Analysis:** ABA vs Gibberellins.
    - **Answer:** ABA promotes dormancy and inhibits growth; Gibberellins break dormancy and promote growth.
34. **Competency:** *Mimosa* mechanism.
    - **Answer:** Electrical stimulus causes K+ and water to leave pulvinus cells, causing sudden loss of turgidity and drooping.
35. **Case:** Rapid cell division chemical.
    - **Answer:** Cytokinin.
36. **Creating:** Sensitivity hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Roots respond to much lower concentrations of stimuli than shoots.
37. **Designing:** Apical Dominance aid.
    - **Answer:** [Sketch showing tall plant with inhibited side buds vs decapitated plant with growing side buds].
38. **Application:** Rooting of cuttings.
    - **Answer:** Dipping the base of a stem cutting in Auxin solution induces rapid root formation.
39. **Critical Thinking:** No nervous system.
    - **Answer:** Plants coordinate via chemical signals (Hormones) which are slower but effective.
40. **Analysis:** Senescence.
    - **Answer:** Biological aging of plant parts. Delayed by Cytokinins.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Covered tip.
    - **Answer:** No bending. The tip is where light is perceived and auxin is produced.
42. **Designing:** Phytohormone poster.
    - **Answer:** [Visuals of different hormones and their "jobs"].
43. **Application:** 2,4-D safety in wheat.
    - **Answer:** Wheat (monocot) metabolizes or sequesters the chemical differently, making it resistant to the dose that kills weeds.
44. **Creating:** Tissue culture recipe.
    - **Answer:** High Auxin + Low Cytokinin = Roots. Low Auxin + High Cytokinin = Shoots.
45. **Case Study:** Hormone in drought.
    - **Answer:** Abscisic Acid (ABA). Closes stomata.
46. Biological Clock.
    - **Answer:** Circadian rhythms like sleep movements of leaves.
47. **Critical Thinking:** Response without division.
    - **Answer:** Yes, via turgor changes (e.g., stomata, *Mimosa*).
48. **Analysis:** Speed of response.
    - **Answer:** Nastic (Turgor) is much faster than Tropic (Growth).
49. **Designing:** Coleoptile growth graph.
    - **Answer:** Bell-shaped; growth increases with auxin to an optimum, then decreases due to toxicity/ethylene induction.
50. **Creating:** "Gigantin".
    - **Answer:** Would likely be a variant of Gibberellin that causes extreme cell elongation.
