# Pollution - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Lake covered with algae, fish dying, village runoff.
1. Identify the phenomenon.
   - **Answer:** Eutrophication (followed by Algal Bloom).
2. Nutrients responsible.
   - **Answer:** Nitrates and Phosphates (from detergents and fertilizers).
3. **Designing:** Restoration methods.
   - **Answer:** Diverting sewage away from the lake, and "Bioremediation" (using plants/microbes to absorb excess nutrients).
4. **Analysis:** Why are fish dying?
   - **Answer:** Algae die and are decomposed by bacteria, which use up all the dissolved Oxygen in the water, causing fish to suffocate.
5. Define "BOD".
   - **Answer:** Biological Oxygen Demand - the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material in a water sample.

**Case Study 2:**
City smog in winter, eye irritation.
6. Identify the pollution.
   - **Answer:** Smog (Smoke + Fog).
7. What is "Photochemical Smog"?
   - **Answer:** Smog produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (from car exhausts).
8. **Creating:** Health advisory.
   - **Answer:** "Wear N95 masks, avoid outdoor exercise in the morning, use air purifiers, and keep hydrated."
9. **Critical Thinking:** Stubble burning contribution.
    - **Answer:** Releases massive amounts of smoke and particulate matter (PM) which get trapped in the cold, still air of winter (Temperature Inversion).
10. PM 2.5 and PM 10 role.
    - **Answer:** These fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, causing asthma, bronchitis, and heart disease.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Rainwater Harvesting.
    - **Answer:** [Roof -> Pipes -> Filter -> Storage Tank -> Groundwater Recharge].
17. **Creating:** Slogan.
    - **Answer:** "Clean India, Green India."
18. **Analysis:** Biodegradable vs Non-biodegradable.
    - **Answer:** Biodegradable: Can be broken down by microbes (Paper, Food). Non-biodegradable: Cannot be broken down (Plastic, Glass, DDT).
19. **Designing:** Pollutants table.
    - **Answer:** [CO: Car exhaust (suffocation). SO2: Factories (acid rain). DDT: Pesticide (Biomagnification). Mercury: Industrial waste (Minamata disease)].
20. **Visualisation:** Greenhouse Effect.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Solar rays enter, but heat rays cannot escape through the layer of GHGs].
21. **Application:** Why ban CFCs?
    - **Answer:** They release chlorine atoms in the stratosphere which break down Ozone ($O_3$) molecules into Oxygen ($O_2$), thinning the ozone layer.
22. **Creating:** Waste-to-Wealth.
    - **Answer:** Making paper mache bowls or recycling into cardboard.
23. **Analysis:** Biomagnification of DDT.
    - **Answer:** DDT concentration increases at each trophic level because it is not metabolized; it leads to thin eggshells in birds of prey.
24. **Designing:** Reduce Noise Pollution.
    - **Answer:** Using silencers in machines, "No Honking" zones near hospitals, and planting trees (Green Muffler).
25. **Creating:** Speech on Single-Use Plastic.
    - **Answer:** [Focus on ocean pollution, death of cattle/turtles, and microplastics in food].

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Acid Rain.
    - **Answer:** Rain containing nitric and sulfuric acids. pH below 5.6.
27. **Scenario:** Nuclear radiation risks.
    - **Answer:** DNA damage leading to genetic mutations, leukemia, and other cancers.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Is Greenhouse Effect entirely bad?
    - **Answer:** No, without it, the Earth's average temperature would be -18°C, too cold for most life. The problem is the *enhanced* effect.
29. **Application:** Scrubber/Precipitator.
    - **Answer:** Used in chimney stacks to remove gases (Scrubber) or dust particles (Precipitator) from industrial smoke.
30. Pollutant vs Contaminant.
    - **Answer:** Pollutant: Harmful substance that reduces quality of environment. Contaminant: Substance in the wrong place but not necessarily harmful yet.
31. **Diagram Based:** GHG pie chart.
    - **Answer:** CO2 accounts for approx 60% of the enhanced greenhouse effect.
32. Oil Spills impact.
    - **Answer:** Coats feathers of birds (hypothermia) and prevents gas exchange for marine life.
33. **Analysis:** Unleaded petrol.
    - **Answer:** Lead is a neurotoxin; removing it prevents lead poisoning and allows the use of catalytic converters in cars.

35. **Case:** Minamata disease.
    - **Answer:** Methyl Mercury poisoning.
36. **Creating:** Planting trees hypothesis.
