# Circulatory System - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Patient with breathlessness, fatigue, and low hemoglobin.
1. Identify the condition.
   - **Answer:** Anaemia.
2. Function of hemoglobin.
   - **Answer:** To bind with Oxygen (forming Oxyhaemoglobin) and transport it to the tissues.
3. **Designing:** Diet plan.
   - **Answer:** Spinach, Jaggery, Liver/Red Meat, Pomegranate.
4. **Analysis:** Why fatigue?
   - **Answer:** Less Hb -> Less Oxygen transport -> Less Aerobic Respiration -> Less ATP (energy) production.
5. RBC adaptation.
   - **Answer:** Biconcave shape increases surface area for gas exchange and allows flexibility to pass through capillaries. Lack of nucleus/mitochondria provides more space for Hb.

**Case Study 2:**
Blood pressure 150/95 mmHg.
6. Normal range.
   - **Answer:** 120/80 mmHg.
7. Systolic vs Diastolic.
   - **Answer:** Systolic: Pressure when ventricles contract. Diastolic: Pressure when ventricles relax.
8. **Creating:** Lifestyle changes.
   - **Answer:** Reduce salt intake, regular exercise, weight management, stress reduction.
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why "silent killer"?
   - **Answer:** Often has no noticeable symptoms until it causes severe damage like a stroke or heart attack.
10. Elasticity of arteries.
    - **Answer:** Allows arteries to expand during systole and recoil during diastole, smoothing out the blood flow and maintaining pressure.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

11. **Assertion (A):** Left ventricle has a thicker wall.
    **Reason (R):** It pumps blood to the entire body.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Arteries have valves.
    **Reason (R):** Blood flows under high pressure.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true. (Veins have valves, not arteries).
13. **Assertion (A):** SA node is the pacemaker.
    **Reason (R):** It generates the electrical impulse.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Path of blood flowchart.
    - **Answer:** Vena Cava -> Right Atrium -> Right Ventricle -> Pulmonary Artery -> Lungs -> Pulmonary Veins -> Left Atrium -> Left Ventricle -> Aorta.
17. **Creating:** Phagocyte poster.
    - **Answer:** "Wanted: Phagocyte. Alias: The Eater. Method: Squeezing through walls (Diapedesis) and swallowing enemies (Phagocytosis)."
18. **Analysis:** Artery vs Vein.
    - **Answer:** Arteries: Thick muscular walls, narrow lumen, no valves. Veins: Thin walls, wide lumen, have valves. Veins collapse because they have less muscle and lower internal pressure.
19. **Designing:** Blood compatibility table.
    - **Answer:** [A: receives A/O, B: receives B/O, AB: receives All, O: receives O].
20. **Visualisation:** Heart diagram labels.
    - **Answer:** [Description of heart interior with 4 chambers and valves].
21. **Application:** Heart rate in exercise.
    - **Answer:** To supply more Oxygen and Glucose to the working muscles and remove CO2/Heat faster.
22. **Creating:** Double Circulation metaphor.
    - **Answer:** Like a mail truck that goes to the sorting center (Lungs) and then returns to the main hub (Heart) before delivering to the houses (Body).
23. **Analysis:** Hepatic Portal Vein.
    - **Answer:** To transport absorbed nutrients (Glucose/Amino acids) from the intestine directly to the liver for processing/detoxification before they enter systemic circulation.
24. **Designing:** First-aid for bleeding.
    - **Answer:** Apply firm pressure. This allows platelets to clump and the clotting cascade to form a fibrin mesh.
25. **Creating:** Platelet autobiography.
    - **Answer:** "I am small but mighty. When there's a leak, I'm the first responder to plug the hole."

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Double Circulation.
    - **Answer:** Blood passes through the heart twice for one complete body circuit (Pulmonary and Systemic). Essential for high metabolic rates.
27. **Scenario:** Hole in septum.
    - **Answer:** Mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, reducing the efficiency of Oxygen delivery to tissues.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Higher RBC in mountains.
    - **Answer:** To compensate for lower Oxygen levels in the atmosphere (Acclimatization).
29. **Application:** Erythroblastosis fetalis.
    - **Answer:** Rh- mother with Rh+ fetus. Mother develops anti-Rh antibodies which can attack the RBCs of a second Rh+ fetus.
30. Serum vs Plasma.
    - **Answer:** Plasma: Liquid part of blood with clotting factors. Serum: Plasma minus clotting factors.
31. **Diagram Based:** ECG waves.
    - **Answer:** P-wave: Atrial depolarization (contraction). QRS complex: Ventricular depolarization (contraction).
32. Lymphatic System function.
    - **Answer:** Drainage of excess tissue fluid, absorption of fats, and immune defense.
33. **Analysis:** Spleen graveyard.
    - **Answer:** Old and worn-out RBCs are broken down here by macrophages.
34. **Competency:** Clotting mechanism.
    - **Answer:** Thromboplastin + Calcium -> Prothrombin to Thrombin -> Fibrinogen to Fibrin (insoluble threads).
35. **Case:** Orthostatic hypotension.
    - **Answer:** Gravity pulls blood to legs; the heart must beat faster/vessels constrict to maintain brain blood flow.
36. **Creating:** Caffeine hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Caffeine stimulates the nervous system/adrenal glands, increasing heart rate.
37. **Designing:** Open vs Closed system aid.
    - **Answer:** Open: Blood bathes organs directly. Closed: Blood stays inside vessels.
38. **Application:** Atherosclerosis and heart attack.
    - **Answer:** Plaque narrows coronary arteries, reducing blood/oxygen flow to heart muscle.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Capillary thickness.
    - **Answer:** One-cell thick wall allows for rapid diffusion of gases and nutrients.
40. **Analysis:** Lub-Dub sounds.
    - **Answer:** 'Lub': Closure of Atrio-ventricular valves. 'Dub': Closure of Semi-lunar valves.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Heart beat after nerves cut.
    - **Answer:** Yes, it will beat because the impulse is generated within the heart muscle (SA Node).
42. **Designing:** Stethoscope model.
    - **Answer:** Funnel picks up vibrations; tube transmits them directly to the ear.
43. **Application:** Tissue Fluid formation.
    - **Answer:** High hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of capillaries forces fluid out into the spaces between cells.
44. **Creating:** Lymph vs Blood table.
    - **Answer:** [Blood: RBCs, high protein, high pressure. Lymph: No RBCs, low protein, low pressure].
45. **Case Study:** Thrombocytopenia.
    - **Answer:** Internal or excessive external bleeding due to failure of clotting.
46. Calcium and Vitamin K.
    - **Answer:** Calcium is a cofactor for clotting enzymes; Vitamin K is needed by the liver to synthesize prothrombin.
