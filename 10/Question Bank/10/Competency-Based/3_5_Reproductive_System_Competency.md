# Reproductive System - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Male partner with low sperm count.
1. Where are sperms produced?
   - **Answer:** Seminiferous tubules of the testes.
2. Why is the scrotum outside?
   - **Answer:** To maintain a temperature 2-3°C lower than the body temperature, which is essential for sperm production (spermatogenesis).
3. **Designing:** Lifestyle changes.
   - **Answer:** Wear loose clothing, avoid hot tubs/saunas, avoid placing laptops directly on the lap.
4. **Analysis:** Temperature requirement.
   - **Answer:** High body temperature can denature proteins/enzymes involved in sperm formation or kill developing sperm.
5. Function of Epididymis.
   - **Answer:** Storage and maturation of sperms (they gain motility here).

**Case Study 2:**
Positive HCG test in woman.
6. Source of HCG.
   - **Answer:** Placenta (initially from the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst).
7. What does it indicate?
   - **Answer:** Pregnancy (Implantation has occurred).
8. **Creating:** Timeline.
   - **Answer:** Day 0: Fertilization. Day 3: Morula. Day 5-7: Blastocyst. Day 7-9: Implantation.
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why does corpus luteum persist?
   - **Answer:** HCG signals the corpus luteum to continue producing Progesterone, which maintains the uterine lining for the embryo.
10. Function of Progesterone during pregnancy.
    - **Answer:** Prevents menstruation and keeps the endometrium thick and vascular for the fetus.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Testes are outside in scrotum.
    **Reason (R):** Sperm formation requires lower temp.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Urethra in males is urinogenital.
    **Reason (R):** It carries urine and semen.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
13. **Assertion (A):** Menstruation occurs if egg is not fertilized.
    **Reason (R):** Breakdown of endometrial lining.

14. **Assertion (A):** Placenta is a permeable barrier.
    **Reason (R):** It allows mixing of blood.
    - **Answer:** (c) A is true but R is false. (Maternal and fetal blood do NOT mix; exchange happens by diffusion).
15. **Assertion (A):** Tubectomy is a sterilization method.
    **Reason (R):** Fallopian tubes are cut and tied.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Menstrual Cycle flowchart.
    - **Answer:** Menstrual Phase (Day 1-5) -> Follicular Phase (Estrogen up) -> Ovulation (Day 14, LH up) -> Luteal Phase (Progesterone up).
17. **Creating:** Growth Chart.
    - **Answer:** 1st: Heart/Limbs form. 2nd: Hair/Eyelashes, movement felt. 3rd: Lungs mature, fat storage.
18. **Analysis:** Identical vs Fraternal Twins.
    - **Answer:** Identical: 1 Egg + 1 Sperm -> Zygote splits (Same sex/DNA). Fraternal: 2 Eggs + 2 Sperms (Can be different sex/DNA).
19. **Designing:** Male glands table.
    - **Answer:** [Seminal Vesicle: Fructose (energy). Prostate: Alkaline fluid (neutralize acidity). Cowper's: Lubrication].
20. **Visualisation:** Sperm diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Head with Acrosome, Mid-piece with spiral Mitochondria, Tail]. Acrosome: Enzymes to penetrate egg membrane.
21. **Application:** Breast milk benefits.
    - **Answer:** Contains Colostrum rich in antibodies ($IgA$) that provide passive immunity to the baby.
22. **Creating:** Journey of a sperm.
    - **Answer:** Testes -> Epididymis -> Vas Deferens -> Urethra -> Vagina -> Cervix -> Uterus -> Fallopian Tube.
23. **Analysis:** Amniotic Fluid.
    - **Answer:** Protects fetus from mechanical shocks and maintains constant temperature.
24. **Designing:** Health poster.
    - **Answer:** [Visuals on cleanliness, awareness of STDs, and balanced nutrition for mothers].
25. **Creating:** Dialogue.
    - **Answer:** Estrogen: "I build the walls." Progesterone: "I keep them steady for the baby."

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Ovulation.
    - **Answer:** Release of secondary oocyte from the Graafian follicle. Day 14. Triggered by LH (Luteinizing Hormone).
27. **Scenario:** Vasectomy results.
    - **Answer:** Sperm production continues but they can't leave the testes. Ejaculation still occurs (fluid from glands) but it contains no sperms.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Mitochondria in sperm.
    - **Answer:** Provides energy (ATP) for the tail movement to swim towards the egg.
29. **Application:** IVF.
    - **Answer:** Fertilization outside the body. Recommended for blocked fallopian tubes or low sperm motility.
30. Menarche vs Menopause.
    - **Answer:** Menarche: First menstrual cycle (puberty). Menopause: Permanent cessation of menstrual cycles (age 45-50).
31. **Diagram Based:** Female Reproductive System.
    - **Answer:** Fertilization occurs in the Fallopian tube (Ampulla-isthmus junction).
32. Placenta functions.
    - **Answer:** Nutrient supply, O2/CO2 exchange, Waste removal, Hormone production (Estrogen, Progesterone, HCG).
33. **Analysis:** Why so many sperms?
    - **Answer:** Most die in the acidic vagina or lose their way; many are needed to dissolve the egg's protective layers.
34. **Competency:** Egg path.
    - **Answer:** Ovary -> Fimbriae -> Fallopian tube (cilia and peristalsis move it) -> Uterus.
35. **Case:** Fertile period.
    - **Answer:** Usually Day 10 to Day 17 of the cycle (considering sperm life and ovulation timing).
36. **Creating:** Puberty hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Better nutrition/higher body fat often leads to earlier onset of menarche.
37. **Designing:** Umbilical Cord.
    - **Answer:** Connects the fetus to the placenta; contains two arteries and one vein.
38. **Application:** Pregnancy kits.
    - **Answer:** Use antibodies to detect HCG in urine; color change indicates binding.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Pregnancy after Menopause?
    - **Answer:** No natural pregnancy as egg production has stopped. (IVF with donor eggs is possible but medically complex).
40. **Analysis:** Gestation Period.
    - **Answer:** The time from fertilization to birth. Humans: Approx 280 days (9 months and 7 days).

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Ectopic Pregnancy.
    - **Answer:** The tube is too narrow to accommodate a growing fetus and lacks a thick vascular lining like the uterus; it can rupture, causing internal bleeding.
42. **Designing:** Uterus layers.
    - **Answer:** Perimetrium (Outer), Myometrium (Muscle - for birth), Endometrium (Inner - shed in menses).
43. **Application:** Parturition.
    - **Answer:** The act of giving birth. Induced by Oxytocin.
44. **Creating:** Crossword.
    - **Answer:** [Terms: Zygote (Fertilized egg), Gamete (Sex cell)].
45. **Case Study:** Fetal circulation (Foramen Ovale).
    - **Answer:** In fetus, blood bypasses lungs via a hole between atria because lungs aren't used for O2.
46. Crossing Over significance.
    - **Answer:** Swapping of genetic material between homologous chromosomes creates new gene combinations and variation.
47. **Critical Thinking:** Prostate enlargement.
    - **Answer:** Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is common in aging men; it can squeeze the urethra and cause urinary problems.
48. **Analysis:** Spermatogenesis vs Oogenesis.
    - **Answer:** Spermatogenesis: Continuous, 4 equal gametes. Oogenesis: Discontinuous, 1 large egg and polar bodies.
49. **Designing:** Temperature graph.
    - **Answer:** Temperature rises slightly (approx 0.5°C) after ovulation due to progesterone.
50. **Creating:** New contraceptive.
    - **Answer:** E.g., Male hormonal pill that stops sperm production without affecting libido.
