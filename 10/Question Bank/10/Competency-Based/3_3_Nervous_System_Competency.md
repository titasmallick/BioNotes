# Nervous System - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Accidentally touching a hot pan and withdrawing hand.
1. Identify the action.
   - **Answer:** Reflex Action.
2. Trace the pathway.
   - **Answer:** Receptor (Skin) -> Sensory Neuron -> Spinal Cord -> Motor Neuron -> Effector (Muscle).
3. **Designing:** Schematic diagram.
   - **Answer:** [Description: Arc shape connecting skin to spinal cord and back to muscle].
4. **Analysis:** Why withdrawal before pain?
   - **Answer:** The reflex arc is local to the spinal cord for speed. The message to the brain (pain perception) travels through a longer path and takes slightly more time.
5. Damaged motor neuron?
   - **Answer:** The person will feel the pain (sensory works) but will not be able to move the hand (effector fails).

**Case Study 2:**
Elderly person with Parkinson's (lack of Dopamine).
6. What is a "Synapse"?
   - **Answer:** The microscopic gap between the axon terminal of one neuron and the dendrite of the next.
7. Role of neurotransmitters.
   - **Answer:** They are chemicals (like Acetylcholine or Dopamine) released from vesicles that diffuse across the synapse to transmit the impulse to the next neuron.
8. **Creating:** Analogy.
   - **Answer:** Like a relay race where the baton (neurotransmitter) is handed from one runner to the next at the exchange zone (synapse).
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why one direction?
   - **Answer:** Vesicles containing neurotransmitters are only present at the axon terminals, and receptors are only present on the dendrites.
10. Resting vs Action Potential.
    - **Answer:** Resting: Neuron is not conducting (-70mV). Action: Reversal of polarity (+30mV) during conduction of an impulse.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Cerebellum controls balance.
    **Reason (R):** It coordinates muscular activity.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Medulla Oblongata is vital.
    **Reason (R):** It controls involuntary activities.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

14. **Assertion (A):** Blind spot is area of best vision.
    **Reason (R):** It has maximum Cones.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true (in definition of fovea, but for blind spot, both are false). Correct Answer: (d) A is false. (Blind spot has no photoreceptors).
15. **Assertion (A):** Myopia corrected by concave lens.
    **Reason (R):** Concave lens diverges light.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Nervous System classification.
    - **Answer:** CNS (Brain, Spinal Cord) and PNS (Somatic, Autonomic: Sympathetic/Parasympathetic).
17. **Creating:** Eye User Manual (Accommodation).
    - **Answer:** For near objects: Ciliary muscles contract -> Suspensory ligaments slacken -> Lens becomes more convex. Opposite for far objects.
18. **Analysis:** Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic.
    - **Answer:** Sympathetic (Emergency): Increases heart rate, dilates pupil. Parasympathetic (Rest): Decreases heart rate, constricts pupil.
19. **Designing:** Cerebrum vs Cerebellum table.
    - **Answer:** Cerebrum: Large, memory/intellect, outer grey. Cerebellum: Small, balance/coordination, outer grey with tree-like white inside.
20. **Visualisation:** Neuron diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Star-shaped cyton with a long tail]. Myelin sheath acts as insulation and increases speed of impulse (Saltatory conduction).
21. **Application:** Dizziness after spinning.
    - **Answer:** The fluid (endolymph) in the semicircular canals continues to move due to inertia even after the head stops, sending false signals to the brain.
22. **Creating:** Anosmia effect on taste.
    - **Answer:** Flavor is a combination of smell and taste. Without smell, food tastes bland and complex flavors cannot be distinguished.
23. **Analysis:** "All-or-None" law.
    - **Answer:** A stimulus must reach a threshold to trigger an impulse. Once triggered, the impulse always has the same strength regardless of the stimulus intensity.
24. **Designing:** Color Blindness test.
    - **Answer:** Use Ishihara plates (dots of different colors forming numbers).
25. **Creating:** Hearing path.
    - **Answer:** Sound -> Pinna -> Eardrum (Vibration) -> Hammer/Anvil/Stirrup (Amplification) -> Cochlea (Fluid waves) -> Auditory Nerve.

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Gray vs White Matter.
    - **Answer:** Gray: Cytons and non-myelinated fibers. White: Myelinated axons. Brain: Gray outside. Spinal Cord: Gray inside (H-shape).
27. **Scenario:** Memory loss part.
    - **Answer:** Cerebrum (specifically the hippocampus/temporal lobes).
28. **Critical Thinking:** Inverted image perception.
    - **Answer:** The brain interprets the inverted image and "flips" it upright during processing.
29. **Application:** Presbyopia vs Hypermetropia.
    - **Answer:** Hypermetropia: Eyeball too short/lens too flat. Presbyopia: Loss of lens elasticity due to age. Both cause difficulty seeing near objects.
30. Natural vs Conditioned Reflex.
    - **Answer:** Natural: Inborn (e.g., blinking). Conditioned: Learned through experience (e.g., salivating at the sound of a bell).
31. **Diagram Based:** Eustachian tube.
    - **Answer:** It equalizes air pressure on both sides of the eardrum.
32. Corpus Callosum function.
    - **Answer:** It is a band of white fibers that allows communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
33. **Analysis:** Binocular Vision advantage.
    - **Answer:** Provides depth perception (stereoscopic vision) because each eye sees from a slightly different angle.
34. **Competency:** Organ of Corti.
    - **Answer:** The sensory part of the cochlea containing hair cells that convert mechanical vibrations into electrical nerve impulses.
35. **Case:** Pupil constriction.
    - **Answer:** Pupillary Light Reflex. Controlled by the Iris (circular muscles).
