# Absorption by Roots - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
A student sets up a potato osmoscope using strong sugar solution and water.
1. Identify the process responsible for the rise in the sugar solution level.
   - **Answer:** Endosmosis.
2. What acts as the semi-permeable membrane in this setup?
   - **Answer:** The living cytoplasmic lining of the potato cells.
3. **Designing:** What would happen if the potato was boiled?
   - **Answer:** No rise in level. Boiling kills the cells, destroying the semi-permeable nature of the membrane, making it freely permeable.
4. **Analysis:** Direction of water movement.
   - **Answer:** From Hypotonic (water in beaker) to Hypertonic (sugar solution in cavity).
5. If the beaker and cavity have the same concentration?
   - **Answer:** No net movement; level stays the same (Isotonic).

**Case Study 2:**
A farmer applies excessive chemical fertilizer and plants wilt.
6. Identify the condition.
   - **Answer:** Plasmolysis.
7. Explain "Hypertonic solution" in this context.
   - **Answer:** The high concentration of fertilizer in the soil makes the soil water hypertonic compared to the cell sap of the root hairs.
8. **Creating:** Visual representation.
   - **Answer:** [Description: Plasmolysed cell shows shrunken protoplasm away from the cell wall].
9. **Critical Thinking:** How to reverse it?
   - **Answer:** Deplasmolysis by adding plenty of water to the soil to make it hypotonic.
10. Define "Exosmosis" and relate to wilting.
    - **Answer:** Exosmosis is the outward movement of water from the cell. Loss of turgidity leads to wilting.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Roots absorb water by osmosis.
    **Reason (R):** Cell sap has higher concentration than soil water.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Active transport requires energy (ATP).
    **Reason (R):** It moves ions against concentration gradient.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
13. **Assertion (A):** A plant cell bursts if placed in distilled water.
    **Reason (R):** Wall pressure counteracts turgor pressure.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true. (Plant cells don't burst due to cell wall).
14. **Assertion (A):** Salt is a preservative.
    **Reason (R):** Salt causes plasmolysis in bacteria.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
15. **Assertion (A):** Wooden doors swell in rainy season.
    **Reason (R):** This is due to Imbibition.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Root Pressure experiment.
    - **Answer:** Cut the stem of a potted plant near the base; attach a glass tube with a rubber connection. Water rises in the tube due to root pressure.
17. **Creating:** Metaphor for Semi-permeable membrane.
    - **Answer:** Like a sieve that allows water through but stops the noodles (solute).
18. **Analysis:** Diffusion vs Osmosis.
    - **Answer:** Osmosis is diffusion of solvent through a semi-permeable membrane.
19. **Designing:** Table TP vs WP.
    - **Answer:** TP (Turgor Pressure) is exerted by the cell contents against the wall. WP (Wall Pressure) is exerted by the wall against the contents. In turgid cell, TP = WP.
20. **Visualisation:** Root hair diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Long extension of epiblema cell with large vacuole and thin wall]. Wall is freely permeable because it's cellulose.
21. **Application:** Saltwater gargle.
    - **Answer:** Hypertonic salt water causes exosmosis from the swollen tissues/bacteria, reducing inflammation.
22. **Creating:** Journey of a water molecule.
    - **Answer:** Soil -> Root Hair -> Cortex -> Endodermis -> Pericycle -> Xylem.
23. **Analysis:** Surface Area of root hairs.
    - **Answer:** Thousands of root hairs vastly increase the surface area available for absorption.
24. **Designing:** Test if tissue is alive.
    - **Answer:** Place in sugar solution; if it plasmolyses, it's alive.
25. **Creating:** Why plants "drink".
    - **Answer:** Plants use water to stand tall (turgidity) and to cook their food (photosynthesis).

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. DPD (Diffusion Pressure Deficit).
    - **Answer:** The thirst of a cell for water. DPD = OP - TP.
27. **Scenario:** Force at night.
    - **Answer:** Root Pressure.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Distilled water in IV?
    - **Answer:** No. It would cause RBCs to swell and burst (Haemolysis) because it's hypotonic to blood.
29. **Application:** Guttation.
    - **Answer:** Loss of liquid water from hydathodes. Dew is atmospheric condensation.
30. Apoplast vs Symplast.
    - **Answer:** Apoplast: Through cell walls. Symplast: Through cytoplasm/plasmodesmata.
31. **Diagram Based:** Turgid cell arrows.
    - **Answer:** TP outwards, WP inwards.
32. Cohesion and Adhesion.
    - **Answer:** Cohesion: Water-water attraction. Adhesion: Water-Xylem wall attraction.
33. **Analysis:** Fish osmoregulation.
    - **Answer:** Freshwater fish are hypertonic to water, so water enters by osmosis; they don't need to drink.
34. **Competency:** Endodermis checkpost.
    - **Answer:** Casparian strip forces water/minerals through the cell membrane (Symplast), allowing the cell to regulate entry.
35. **Case:** Cutting stem underwater.
    - **Answer:** Prevents air bubbles from entering the Xylem, which would break the water column.
36. **Creating:** Temp hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Rate of absorption increases with temperature up to a certain point due to kinetic energy.
37. **Designing:** Passive vs Active Absorption.
    - **Answer:** Passive: Driven by transpiration pull (No ATP). Active: Driven by roots using energy (ATP).
38. **Application:** Killing weeds with salt.
    - **Answer:** Causes exosmosis from roots, leading to physiological drought and death.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Fully turgid absorption.
    - **Answer:** No more water can enter when Water Potential is zero (TP = OP).
40. **Analysis:** Hydrotropism movement.
    - **Answer:** Differential cell elongation on the side with more water.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Water flow direction (DPD).
    - **Answer:** Cell A (DPD=4), Cell B (DPD=5). Water flows from lower DPD to higher DPD (A to B).
42. **Designing:** Imbibition model.
    - **Answer:** Soak dry seeds in a graduated cylinder. Measure the increase in volume.
43. **Application:** Importance of Turgidity.
    - **Answer:** Provides mechanical support to herbaceous plants and drives movements like stomatal opening.
44. **Creating:** Ascent of Sap graphic.
    - **Answer:** [Loop showing Root Pressure (push), Capillarity (minor), Transpiration Pull (main pull)].
45. **Case Study:** Transplanted plant death.
    - **Answer:** Loss of delicate root hairs means the plant cannot absorb enough water to replace what is transpired.
46. Isotonic Solution.
    - **Answer:** Solution with same concentration as cell sap; no net movement of water.
47. **Critical Thinking:** Fertilizer and soil OP.
    - **Answer:** More solutes increase the Osmotic Pressure of soil, making it harder for roots to absorb water.
48. **Analysis:** Plasmolysis vs Flaccidity.
    - **Answer:** Plasmolysis: Protoplasm shrunken. Flaccidity: Cell is not turgid but protoplasm still touches the wall.
49. **Designing:** Rate vs Soil Temp graph.
    - **Answer:** Rate is low at 0°C (viscous water), increases with temp, then drops at very high temp (membrane damage).
50. **Creating:** "Super Root".
    - **Answer:** Deep taproot, high concentration of solutes in sap, and thick mucilage coating.
