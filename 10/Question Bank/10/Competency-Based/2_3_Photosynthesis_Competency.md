# Photosynthesis - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
Experiment to test the necessity of light for photosynthesis.
1. Why destarch?
   - **Answer:** To ensure that any starch found at the end of the experiment was synthesized during the experiment, not before.
2. boiling in alcohol?
   - **Answer:** To remove chlorophyll (decolorize the leaf) so that the blue-black color change with Iodine is clearly visible.
3. **Designing:** Predict observation.
   - **Answer:** Exposed part turns blue-black (starch present). Covered part stays brown/yellow (no starch).
4. **Analysis:** Why use a water bath?
   - **Answer:** Alcohol is highly inflammable and should not be heated directly over a flame.
5. If forgot to destarch?
   - **Answer:** The entire leaf would turn blue-black, giving a false-positive result for the covered part.

**Case Study 2:**
Engelmann's experiment with *Spirogyra* and aerobic bacteria.
6. Conclusion on wavelengths.
   - **Answer:** Blue and red light are the most effective for photosynthesis.
7. Why did bacteria accumulate?
   - **Answer:** Photosynthesis was highest in blue and red regions, releasing the most Oxygen. Aerobic bacteria move towards oxygen-rich areas (Chemotaxis).
8. **Creating:** Action Spectrum graph.
   - **Answer:** [Graph showing two peaks, one in blue and one in red region].
9. **Critical Thinking:** Why do leaves appear green?
   - **Answer:** Green light is reflected or transmitted by the leaf, not absorbed.
10. Role of Chlorophyll a and b.
    - **Answer:** Chlorophyll a is the primary pigment (Reaction center). Chlorophyll b is an accessory pigment that captures light and passes it to Chlorophyll a.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Mohl's Half-Leaf Experiment.
    - **Answer:** Part of leaf inside bottle with KOH (absorbs CO2). After starch test, part inside bottle shows no starch.
17. **Creating:** Flowchart.
    - **Answer:** Light Phase (Grana, uses Light/H2O, produces ATP/NADPH/O2) -> Dark Phase (Stroma, uses CO2/ATP/NADPH, produces Glucose).
18. **Analysis:** Plant in atmosphere without CO2.
    - **Answer:** Photosynthesis stops. It will use stored starch for respiration until it's exhausted, then die.
19. **Designing:** Chloroplast diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Outer/Inner membrane, stacks of Thylakoids (Grana), fluid Stroma]. Chlorophyll is in Thylakoid membranes.
20. **Visualisation:** Balanced equation.
    - **Answer:** $6CO_2 + 12H_2O \xrightarrow{Light/Chlorophyll} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6H_2O + 6O_2$.
21. **Application:** Sleeping under a tree.
    - **Answer:** At night, trees only respire, releasing CO2 and taking in O2, which can cause discomfort/suffocation.
22. **Creating:** World with Green-light plants.
    - **Answer:** Plants would likely appear Red or Purple (reflecting what they don't use).
23. **Analysis:** Limiting Factors.
    - **Answer:** The rate is determined by the factor that is at its lowest level (e.g., low CO2 even in bright light).
24. **Designing:** Phosphorylation vs Photophosphorylation.
    - **Answer:** Photophosphorylation uses light energy to add phosphate to ADP.
25. **Creating:** Carbon Cycle role.
    - **Answer:** Photosynthesis is the only major process that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and fixes it into organic matter.

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Photolysis fate.
    - **Answer:** H+ ions reduce NADP to NADPH. Electrons (e-) replace those lost by Chlorophyll. O is released as gas.
27. **Scenario:** Why not land plants for O2 bubbles?
    - **Answer:** In land plants, O2 diffuses out through stomata; in aquatic plants, it's released as visible bubbles through the water.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Oxidation-Reduction.
    - **Answer:** Water is oxidized (loses H+); CO2 is reduced (gains H+).
29. **Application:** Pollution effect.
    - **Answer:** Dust blocks sunlight and clogs stomata, reducing both light absorption and CO2 entry.
30. Palisade vs Spongy.
    - **Answer:** Palisade has more chloroplasts and is tightly packed for maximum light absorption. Spongy has air spaces for gas exchange.
31. **Diagram Based:** Saturation point.
    - **Answer:** The point where the curve flattens out.
32. Fate of Glucose.
    - **Answer:** Used for energy, converted to Starch for storage, or Sucrose for transport.
33. **Analysis:** Variegated leaves.
    - **Answer:** Shows that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.
34. **Competency:** ATP and NADPH role.
    - **Answer:** They provide the energy and reducing power needed to convert CO2 into Glucose in the Calvin Cycle.
35. **Case:** Greenhouse yield.
    - **Answer:** Increase light (LEDs) and supplement CO2 levels (CO2 generators).
36. **Creating:** Intermittent light.
    - **Answer:** Yes, because the light reaction is fast, but the dark reaction can continue in the intervals between light pulses.
37. **Designing:** ADP to ATP.
    - **Answer:** Like a rechargeable battery getting charged.
38. **Application:** Global Warming.
    - **Answer:** Higher CO2 may increase photosynthesis, but the associated heat and drought might offset this benefit.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Artificial light.
    - **Answer:** Yes, as long as the light contains the required wavelengths (Blue and Red).
40. **Analysis:** Leaf adaptations.
    - **Answer:** Large surface area, thin (short diffusion path), extensive vein network (transport).

43. **Application:** Sugarcane vs Wheat.
    - **Answer:** Sugarcane (C4) can continue photosynthesis at very low CO2 and high temps by avoiding photorespiration.
44. **Creating:** Respiration vs Photosynthesis.

    - **Answer:** They open stomata at night to store CO2 as organic acids, then use it during the day when stomata are closed.
48. **Analysis:** Water stress.
    - **Answer:** Lack of water causes stomata to close to save water, which limits CO2 supply.
49. **Designing:** Temp graph.
    - **Answer:** Bell curve; peak at 25-35°C.
50. **Creating:** Solar leaf.
    - **Answer:** Flexible, self-healing, water-splitting technology.
