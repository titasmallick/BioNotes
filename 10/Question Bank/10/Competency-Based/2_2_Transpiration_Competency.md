# Transpiration - Competency-Based Question Bank (with Answers)

## Section A: Case-Based Questions

**Case Study 1:**
A student sets up a Ganong's Potometer.
1. What is the principle behind using a Potometer?
   - **Answer:** It measures the rate of water uptake, which is almost equal to the rate of transpiration.
2. Why cut the twig underwater?
   - **Answer:** To prevent an air lock (embolism) in the Xylem.
3. **Designing:** Predict the effect of a fan.
   - **Answer:** The bubble will move faster because the fan removes the humid air around the leaf, increasing the diffusion gradient.
4. **Analysis:** Why not 100% accurate?
   - **Answer:** Some water is used in photosynthesis or for cell turgidity, not all is transpired.
5. Resetting the air bubble.
   - **Answer:** Open the stopcock of the reservoir to let water push the bubble back.

**Case Study 2:**
Balsam plant wilting in afternoon, recovering in evening.
6. Identify the phenomenon.
   - **Answer:** Temporary wilting.
7. Explain the imbalance.
   - **Answer:** In the afternoon, the rate of transpiration exceeds the rate of water absorption.
8. **Creating:** Flowchart.
   - **Answer:** High heat -> Rapid transpiration -> Cell water loss -> Loss of turgidity -> Drooping (Wilting).
9. **Critical Thinking:** Is wilting always harmful?
   - **Answer:** No, it reduces the surface area exposed to the sun and closes stomata, preventing further water loss.
10. Temporary vs Permanent Wilting.
    - **Answer:** Temporary: Recovers with water/time. Permanent: Damage is irreversible, plant dies.

## Section B: Assertion-Reasoning Questions

*Directions: (a) Both A/R true, R explains A; (b) Both true, R doesn't explain A; (c) A true, R false; (d) A false, R true.*

11. **Assertion (A):** Transpiration creates a suction force.
    **Reason (R):** This force helps in the ascent of sap.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
12. **Assertion (A):** Stomata close at night in most plants.
    **Reason (R):** Closure prevents water loss when photosynthesis isn't occurring.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
13. **Assertion (A):** High humidity increases the rate of transpiration.
    **Reason (R):** The diffusion gradient is reduced.
    - **Answer:** (d) A is false but R is true. (Humidity decreases transpiration).
14. **Assertion (A):** Some desert plants have sunken stomata.
    **Reason (R):** They reduce transpiration by creating a pocket of humid air.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.
15. **Assertion (A):** Transpiration is a "necessary evil".
    **Reason (R):** It leads to water loss but is essential for cooling and transport.
    - **Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation.

## Section C: Creating and Designing (Application & Analysis)

16. **Designing:** Cobalt Chloride paper experiment.
    - **Answer:** Clip dry paper on both sides; the paper on the lower surface turns pink faster, showing more transpiration.
17. **Creating:** Pie chart data.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Large slice for Stomata, small for Cuticle, sliver for Lenticels].
18. **Analysis:** Stomatal vs Lenticular.
    - **Answer:** Stomatal can be regulated by guard cells; Lenticular is constant (no regulation).
19. **Designing:** 24-hour graph.
    - **Answer:** Peaks at noon (highest temp/light), zero or low at night.
20. **Visualisation:** Open stoma diagram.
    - **Answer:** [Description: Kidney-shaped guard cells, open pore, chloroplasts shown].
21. **Application:** Cooling effect.
    - **Answer:** Evaporation of water from leaves absorbs latent heat from the plant and surrounding air.
22. **Creating:** Super-Arid plant modifications.
    - **Answer:** Spines instead of leaves, thick waxy cuticle, CAM photosynthesis.
23. **Analysis:** K+ ion theory.
    - **Answer:** In light, K+ ions enter guard cells -> Water enters by osmosis -> Turgidity causes opening.
24. **Designing:** Checklist.
    - **Answer:** Temperature (+), Wind (+), Light (+), Humidity (-).
25. **Creating:** Rhyme.
    - **Answer:** "From the roots to the sky, water flows when the air is dry."

## Section D: Competency & Critical Thinking

26. Compromise.
    - **Answer:** Stomata must open for CO2 (Photosynthesis) but this inevitably lets water out (Transpiration).
27. **Scenario:** Vaseline on both surfaces.
    - **Answer:** Transpiration and Gas exchange (Photosynthesis/Respiration) will stop. Plant may die.
28. **Critical Thinking:** Needle leaves.
    - **Answer:** Reduce surface area for transpiration and prevent snow accumulation.
29. **Application:** "Bleeding".
    - **Answer:** Loss of sap from an injured part. Guttation is from intact hydathodes.
30. Cuticular vs Stomatal.
    - **Answer:** Cuticular: Through waxy layer. Stomatal: Through pores.
31. **Diagram Based:** Mesophyll.
    - **Answer:** Spongy mesophyll has many air spaces for easy diffusion of water vapour.
32. Atmospheric Pressure.
    - **Answer:** Low pressure (e.g., on mountains) increases the rate of transpiration.
33. **Analysis:** Anti-transpirants.
    - **Answer:** They reduce water loss without affecting CO2 uptake significantly, helping crops survive drought.
34. **Competency:** Cold soil.
    - **Answer:** Cold water is more viscous and root cell membranes are less permeable, slowing absorption.
35. **Case:** Water confirm test.
    - **Answer:** Cobalt Chloride paper turns blue to pink.
36. **Creating:** Stomatal frequency hypothesis.
    - **Answer:** Use nail polish impressions of the leaf surface to count stomata under a microscope.
37. **Designing:** Guttation vs Transpiration table.
    - **Answer:** [Guttation: Liquid, night/early morning, through hydathodes. Transpiration: Vapour, day, through stomata].
38. **Application:** Deforestation and rainfall.
    - **Answer:** Fewer trees means less water vapour returned to the atmosphere, leading to less cloud formation.
39. **Critical Thinking:** Forest humidifiers.
    - **Answer:** Large amounts of water vapour released by trees increase local humidity.
40. **Analysis:** Relative Humidity.
    - **Answer:** If air is already full of moisture (High RH), there is no "room" for transpired water.

## Section E: Advanced Competency

41. **Scenario:** Monocot vs Dicot stomata.
    - **Answer:** Monocot: Equal on both sides. Dicot: More on the lower surface.
42. **Designing:** Cohesion-Tension model.
    - **Answer:** Pulling a wet rope through a pipe; the surface tension of water pulls the rest of the column up.
43. **Application:** Shedding leaves in autumn.
    - **Answer:** To prevent water loss during winter when soil water may be frozen and unavailable.
44. **Creating:** Guard cell diary.
    - **Answer:** "Sun's out, K+ is in! Feeling plump and open."
45. **Case Study:** Blue light receptor.
    - **Answer:** Phototropin. Blue light is the most effective for stomatal opening.
46. Thick Cuticle in xerophytes.
    - **Answer:** Acts as a physical barrier to prevent non-stomatal water loss.
47. **Critical Thinking:** Aquatic plants.
    - **Answer:** Submerged plants lack stomata and do not transpire. Floating plants have stomata on the upper surface.
48. **Analysis:** Windy vs Still day.
    - **Answer:** Wind removes the "layer" of humidity next to the leaf, keeping the gradient steep.
49. **Designing:** Advantages and Disadvantages.
    - **Answer:** [Advantages: Ascent of sap, Cooling, Mineral transport. Disadvantages: Energy loss, Risk of wilting].
50. **Creating:** Improved Potometer.
    - **Answer:** A digital sensor that measures the exact weight loss of the plant (Lysimeter principle).
