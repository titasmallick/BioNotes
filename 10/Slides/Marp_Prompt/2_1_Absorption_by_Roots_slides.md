# Plant Physiology: Absorption by Roots

## 1. Introduction to Water Absorption

*   Crucial for plant survival and growth.
*   Primarily occurs through roots.

---

### 1.1. Characteristics of Roots for Water Absorption

*   **Vast Surface Area:** Numerous branching roots and millions of root hairs.
*   **Semi-Permeable Membrane:** Cell membranes of root hairs.
*   **High Solute Concentration:** Cell sap in root hairs has higher solute concentration than soil water.

---

### 1.2. Structure of a Root Hair

*   Microscopic, tubular extension of an epidermal cell.
*   **Large Surface Area:** For absorbing water and minerals.
*   **Thin Cell Wall:** Permeable to water.
*   **Semi-Permeable Cell Membrane:** Controls substance passage.
*   **Vacuole:** Large central vacuole with high solute concentration.

---

## 2. The Process of Water Absorption

*   Involves imbibition, diffusion, and osmosis.

---

### 2.1. Imbibition

*   Initial step: Water absorbed by solid components of root (cell wall).
*   Driven by affinity of hydrophilic substances for water.
*   Wets root surfaces.

---

### 2.2. Diffusion

*   Net movement of molecules from higher to lower concentration.
*   Water molecules diffuse from soil into root cells.
*   Plays a role across cell wall and cytoplasm.

---

### 2.3. Osmosis

*   Primary mechanism of water absorption.
*   Movement of water across semi-permeable membrane from higher to lower water potential.
*   Driven by osmotic gradient between soil water and cell sap.

---

## 3. Water Potential and its Components

*   **Water potential:** Measure of potential energy of water.
*   **Osmotic Pressure:** Pressure to prevent water flow across membrane. Higher solute = more negative osmotic potential.
*   **Root Pressure:** Positive pressure in xylem due to active mineral transport into root cells. Most evident at night.
*   **Turgor Pressure:** Pressure of cell contents against cell wall. Provides structural support, essential for cell expansion.

---

## 4. Turgidity, Flaccidity, and Plasmolysis

*   **Turgidity:** Cell fully hydrated, membrane pressed against cell wall. Normal state, maintains plant form.
*   **Flaccidity:** Cell loses water, membrane not pressed against cell wall. Leads to wilting.
*   **Plasmolysis:** Cell loses water in hypertonic solution, cell membrane pulls away from cell wall.
*   **Deplasmolysis:** Plasmolyzed cell regains water in hypotonic solution, becomes turgid again.

---

## 5. Absorption of Water and Minerals

*   Water: Primarily osmosis.
*   Mineral ions: Both passive and active transport.
    *   **Passive Transport:** By diffusion, no energy.
    *   **Active Transport:** Against concentration gradient, requires ATP and carrier proteins.

---

## 6. Ascent of Sap

*   Upward movement of water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves.
*   Occurs through **xylem**.

---

### 6.1. Forces Responsible for Ascent of Sap

*   **Cohesion:** Water molecules stick to each other (hydrogen bonds), creating continuous water column.
*   **Adhesion:** Water molecules adhere to xylem vessel walls, supporting water column.
*   **Transpirational Pull:** Primary driving force. Evaporation of water from leaves creates tension, pulling water up.

---

### 6.2. Experiments to Show Conduction of Water Through Xylem

*   Place leafy shoot in colored solution.
*   Veins in leaves turn red, xylem tissue in stem stains red.
*   Confirms xylem as water conduction pathway.
