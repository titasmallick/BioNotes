# Human Evolution

*   Process of change by which people originated from apelike ancestors.
*   Evolved over ~6 million years.

## Theories of Evolution

### Lamarck's Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics

*   Proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.
*   **1. Use and Disuse of Organs:** Organs used frequently become stronger; unused ones deteriorate.
    *   **Example (Use):** Giraffe's long neck from stretching.
    *   **Example (Disuse):** Vestigial organs in humans.
*   **2. Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics:** Traits acquired during lifetime can be passed to offspring.

### Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection

*   Proposed by Charles Darwin ("On the Origin of Species").
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Variation:** Individuals within a population vary.
    *   **Inheritance:** Variations are heritable.
    *   **Competition:** More offspring than can survive, leading to struggle.
    *   **Survival of the Fittest:** Individuals with advantageous traits survive and reproduce more.
*   **Example: Adaptation of the Peppered Moth:**
    *   Before Industrial Revolution: Light moths camouflaged.
    *   After Industrial Revolution (soot): Dark moths camouflaged, became more common.

## Human Ancestors

| Hominin | Key Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Australopithecus** | - **Bipedalism**<br>- Cranial Capacity: ~400-500 cc<br>- Reduced canine teeth<br>- Sloping forehead, prominent brow ridges<br>- Shorter stature, stooped posture |
| **Homo habilis** | - **Fully bipedal**<br>- Cranial Capacity: ~600-750 cc<br>- Smaller canine teeth<br>- Less prominent brow ridges<br>- Taller, more upright posture |
| **Homo erectus** | - **Efficiently bipedal**<br>- Cranial Capacity: ~800-1100 cc<br>- Similar canine size to modern humans<br>- Prominent brow ridges<br>- Similar height/posture to modern humans |
| **Neanderthals** | - **Fully bipedal**<br>- Cranial Capacity: ~1200-1750 cc (often larger than modern humans)<br>- Prominent brow ridges, receding chin<br>- Shorter and stockier, adapted to cold |
| **Cro-Magnon** | - **Fully bipedal**<br>- Cranial Capacity: ~1400-1600 cc<br>- High forehead, reduced brow ridges<br>- Prominent chin<br>- Similar height/posture to modern humans |
| **Homo sapiens sapiens (Modern Man)** | - **Fully bipedal**<br>- Cranial Capacity: Average 1350 cc<br>- Small canine teeth<br>- High forehead, no prominent brow ridges<br>- Prominent chin<br>- Reduced body hair<br>- Tall, fully upright posture |
