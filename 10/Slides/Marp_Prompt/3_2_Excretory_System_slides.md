# Excretory System

---

## A Brief Introduction to Excretory Organs

*   **Lungs:** Remove carbon dioxide (waste from cellular respiration).
*   **Skin:** Excretes sweat (water, salts, small urea) for thermoregulation and waste removal.
*   **Liver:** Detoxifies, converts ammonia to urea.

---

## The Urinary System

*   Main component of the excretory system.
*   **Kidneys:** Filter blood, produce urine.
*   **Ureters:** Carry urine from kidneys to bladder.
*   **Urinary Bladder:** Stores urine.
*   **Urethra:** Expels urine from body.

---

### The Kidneys: Structure and Function

*   Primary organs of excretion.
*   Located on either side of spine, below rib cage.

---

#### External Structure

*   Reddish-brown, bean-shaped.
*   Enclosed by **renal capsule**.
*   **Hilum:** Depression on concave side where renal artery, vein, and ureter attach.

---

#### Internal Structure

1.  **Renal Cortex:** Outer layer, contains glomeruli and convoluted tubules.
2.  **Renal Medulla:** Inner part, organized into cone-shaped **renal pyramids**.
3.  **Renal Pelvis:** Funnel-shaped, collects urine from pyramids, passes to ureter.

---

### Blood Vessels Associated with the Kidneys

*   **Renal Artery:** Supplies oxygenated blood to kidney for filtration (from aorta).
*   **Renal Vein:** Carries deoxygenated, filtered blood from kidney to inferior vena cava.

---

### The Nephron: The Functional Unit of the Kidney

*   Microscopic structural and functional unit.
*   Each kidney has ~1 million nephrons.
*   Responsible for urine formation (ultrafiltration, reabsorption, secretion).

---

#### Parts of a Nephron

1.  **The Renal Corpuscle (Malpighian Capsule):** Initial filtering component.
    *   **The Glomerulus:** Tangled cluster of capillaries.
    *   **The Bowman's Capsule:** Double-walled, cup-like, surrounds glomerulus, collects filtrate.
2.  **The Renal Tubule:** Long, convoluted tube.
    *   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT).**
    *   **The Loop of Henle.**
    *   **The Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT).**
    *   **The Collecting Duct.**

## Urine Formation

*   Three main steps.

---

### 1. Ultrafiltration

*   First step, in Malpighian capsule.
*   High pressure in glomerulus forces water, small solutes from blood into Bowman's capsule.
*   Forms **glomerular filtrate** (primary urine).
*   Non-selective process.

---

### 2. Selective Reabsorption

*   As filtrate passes through renal tubule, essential substances are reclaimed.
*   Most water, glucose, amino acids, essential ions reabsorbed into blood.
*   Highly selective process.

---

### 3. Tubular Secretion

*   Waste products and excess ions (H+, K+, drugs) actively transported from blood into renal tubule.
*   Further cleanses blood, regulates pH.
*   Remaining fluid is urine.
