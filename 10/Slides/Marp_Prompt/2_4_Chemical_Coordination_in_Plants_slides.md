# Plant Physiology: Chemical Coordination in Plants

---

## 1. Plant Growth Regulators (Phytohormones)

*   Chemical messengers regulating plant growth, development, and responses.
*   Produced in small quantities, transported to other parts.

---

### 1.1. Auxins

*   **Primary role:** Cell elongation and differentiation.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   **Cell Elongation:** Leads to stem growth (phototropism, geotropism).
    *   **Apical Dominance:** Inhibits lateral bud growth.
    *   **Root Initiation:** Promotes adventitious roots on cuttings.
    *   **Fruit Development:** Promotes growth, prevents drop, induces parthenocarpy.
    *   **Differentiation of Xylem and Phloem.**
    *   **Herbicide Action:** High concentrations act as selective herbicides (e.g., 2,4-D).

---

### 1.2. Gibberellins (GAs)

*   Primarily known for promoting stem elongation.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   **Stem Elongation:** Significant increase in stem length (dwarf varieties).
    *   **Seed Germination:** Break dormancy, promote germination (stimulate enzymes).
    *   **Flowering:** Can induce flowering in some long-day plants.
    *   **Fruit Development:** Promote fruit growth (e.g., grapes).
    *   **Bolting:** Stem elongation before flowering in rosette plants.

---

### 1.3. Cytokinins

*   Primarily involved in cell division (cytokinesis) and differentiation.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   **Cell Division:** Promote cell division (with auxins).
    *   **Delay Senescence (Aging):** Delay yellowing of leaves.
    *   **Break Apical Dominance:** Promote lateral bud growth.
    *   **Chloroplast Development.**
    *   **Nutrient Mobilization.**

---

### 1.4. Abscisic Acid (ABA)

*   Often called a stress hormone.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   **Stomatal Closure:** Promotes closure during water stress.
    *   **Seed Dormancy:** Induces and maintains dormancy.
    *   **Bud Dormancy:** Promotes dormancy in buds.
    *   **Inhibits Growth:** Generally acts as a growth inhibitor.
    *   **Abscission:** Promotes shedding of leaves, fruits, flowers.

---

### 1.5. Ethylene

*   Gaseous plant hormone.
*   Primarily involved in fruit ripening and senescence.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   **Fruit Ripening:** Promotes ripening of climacteric fruits.
    *   **Senescence and Abscission:** Accelerates aging and shedding.
    *   **Triple Response in Seedlings:** Inhibition of stem elongation, radial swelling, horizontal growth.
    *   **Flowering:** Can induce flowering in some plants (e.g., pineapple).

---

## 2. Tropic Movements in Plants

*   Directional growth responses of a plant organ towards or away from a specific external stimulus.
*   Regulated by plant hormones (especially auxins).

---

### 2.1. Phototropism

*   Growth movement in response to light.
*   **Mechanism:** Auxins migrate to shaded side, promoting greater cell elongation there, causing bending towards light.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Positive Phototropism:** Towards light (shoots, leaves).
    *   **Negative Phototropism:** Away from light (roots, less common).
*   **Example:** Houseplant bending towards a window.

---

### 2.2. Geotropism (Gravitropism)

*   Growth movement in response to gravity.
*   **Mechanism:** Auxins accumulate on lower side. In shoots, promotes growth (upwards). In roots, inhibits growth (downwards).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Positive Geotropism:** Towards gravity (roots).
    *   **Negative Geotropism:** Away from gravity (shoots).
*   **Example:** Radicle growing downwards, plumule growing upwards.

---

### 2.3. Hydrotropism

*   Growth movement in response to water.
*   **Mechanism:** Roots grow towards higher water concentration.
*   **Type:** Roots typically exhibit positive hydrotropism.
*   **Example:** Roots growing towards a leaky water pipe.

---

### 2.4. Thigmotropism

*   Growth movement in response to touch or physical contact.
*   **Mechanism:** Cells on side opposite contact grow faster, causing coiling around support.
*   **Type:** Often positive thigmotropism.
*   **Example:** Coiling of tendrils (pea plants, grapevines).

---

### 2.5. Chemotropism

*   Growth movement in response to a chemical stimulus.
*   **Mechanism:** Growth towards or away from a chemical concentration gradient.
*   **Types:** Positive (towards) or Negative (away).
*   **Example:**
    *   **Positive:** Pollen tube growth towards ovule.
    *   **Negative:** Roots growing away from harmful chemicals.
*   Allows plants to adapt to diverse environments.
