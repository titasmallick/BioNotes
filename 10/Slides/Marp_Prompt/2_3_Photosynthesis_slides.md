# Plant Physiology: Photosynthesis

---

## 1. The Process and Importance of Photosynthesis

*   Fundamental biochemical process.
*   Green plants, algae, some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose).
*   Oxygen released as byproduct.

---

### 1.1. Overall Balanced Chemical Equation

**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**

---

### 1.2. Importance to Life in General

*   **Primary Energy Source:** Base of most food chains.
*   **Oxygen Production:** Maintains atmospheric oxygen levels.
*   **Carbon Dioxide Regulation:** Removes CO₂ from atmosphere, regulates climate.
*   **Formation of Fossil Fuels:** Ancient organic matter converted to fossil fuels.

---

## 2. Site of Photosynthesis: The Chloroplast

*   Specialized organelles, mainly in mesophyll cells of leaves.

---

### 2.1. Internal Structure of Chloroplast

*   **Double Membrane:** Outer and inner.
*   **Stroma:** Fluid-filled space. Site of **dark reactions (biosynthetic phase)**.
*   **Thylakoids:** Interconnected flattened sacs. Site of **light reactions (photochemical phase)**.
*   **Grana:** Stacks of thylakoids.
*   **Stroma Lamellae:** Connect adjacent grana.
*   **Chlorophyll:** Embedded in thylakoid membranes.

---

## 3. Phases of Photosynthesis

### 3.1. Light-Dependent Reactions (Photochemical Phase)

*   Require light energy.
*   **Site:** Thylakoid membranes.
*   **Process:** Light energy converted to ATP and NADPH.
*   **Key events:**
    *   **Activation of Chlorophyll:** Absorbs light, becomes excited.
    *   **Photolysis of Water:** H₂O splits into H⁺, e⁻, O₂. (`2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂`)
    *   **Electron Transport & ATP Formation (Photophosphorylation):** Electrons move through ETC, create proton gradient, ATP synthase produces ATP.
    *   **NADPH Formation:** Electrons and H⁺ reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH.
*   **Summary:** Light energy → ATP, NADPH, O₂ released.

---

### 3.2. Light-Independent Reactions (Biosynthetic Phase / Calvin Cycle)

*   Do not directly require light, use ATP and NADPH.
*   **Site:** Stroma.
*   **Process:** CO₂ fixed, glucose synthesized.
*   **Key events:**
    *   **Carbon Fixation:** CO₂ + RuBP → 3-PGA (catalyzed by RuBisCO).
    *   **Reduction:** ATP and NADPH convert PGA to G3P.
    *   **Regeneration of RuBP:** Most G3P regenerates RuBP; some forms glucose.
*   **Summary:** CO₂ fixed into glucose using ATP and NADPH.

---

## 4. Adaptations in Plants for Photosynthesis

*   **Leaf Structure:** Large surface area, thinness, cuticle, transparent epidermis, palisade/spongy mesophyll.
*   **Stomata:** Regulate CO₂ entry and O₂/water vapor release. Opening/closing by K+ ion exchange.
*   **Chloroplasts:** Abundant, orient for max light absorption.
*   **Vascular Bundles (Veins):** Xylem (water), phloem (sugars).
*   **Root System:** Absorbs water and minerals.

---

## 5. Experiments to Show the Necessity of Factors for Photosynthesis

*   **Destarching:** Keep plant in darkness to use up stored starch.
*   **Starch Test (Iodine Test):** Boil leaf in water, then alcohol (to remove chlorophyll), wash, add iodine. Blue-black = starch.

---

### 5.1. Experiment to Show Necessity of Light

*   Cover part of leaf with black paper.
*   Expose to sunlight.
*   Starch test: Uncovered part turns blue-black, covered part remains yellowish-brown.

---

### 5.2. Experiment to Show Necessity of Carbon Dioxide

*   Place one plant with KOH (absorbs CO₂) and another with plain water (control) under bell jars.
*   Expose to sunlight.
*   Starch test: Plant with KOH shows no starch, control plant shows starch.

---

### 5.3. Experiment to Show Necessity of Chlorophyll

*   Use variegated leaf (green and non-green patches).
*   Expose to sunlight.
*   Starch test: Only green parts turn blue-black.

---

### 5.4. Experiment to Show Formation of Starch

*   Implicitly shown by all experiments: if conditions met, starch forms.

---

### 5.5. Experiment to Show Release of Oxygen

*   Aquatic plant (e.g., *Hydrilla*) under inverted funnel/test tube in water.
*   Place in sunlight.
*   Bubbles (oxygen) collect in test tube. Glowing splint rekindles.

---

## 6. The Carbon Cycle

*   Biogeochemical cycle of carbon exchange among Earth's reservoirs.
*   Photosynthesis plays central role.

---

### 6.1. Diagrammatic Representation of the Carbon Cycle

1.  **Atmospheric CO₂:** Main source for photosynthesis.
2.  **Photosynthesis:** Plants absorb CO₂, convert to organic compounds.
3.  **Consumption:** Carbon transferred through food chains.
4.  **Respiration:** Organisms break down organic carbon, release CO₂.
5.  **Decomposition:** Decomposers break down dead organic matter, release CO₂.
6.  **Fossil Fuel Formation:** Stored carbon in geosphere over millions of years.
7.  **Combustion:** Burning fossil fuels releases CO₂ to atmosphere.
8.  **Oceanic Carbon:** CO₂ dissolves in oceans, used by marine organisms, forms sedimentary rocks.

*   **Summary:** Carbon moves from atmosphere to living organisms (photosynthesis), through food chains, back to atmosphere (respiration, decomposition, combustion), and cycles through oceans/geological reservoirs.
