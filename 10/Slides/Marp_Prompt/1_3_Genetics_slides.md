# Comprehensive Guide to Genetics

## Introduction to Genetics

---

## Mendel's Laws of Inheritance

*   Fundamental principles of heredity, based on pea plant experiments.

---

### 1. The Law of Dominance

*   In a cross between pure, contrasting traits, only the **dominant** trait appears in F1 generation.
*   **Example:** Tall (TT) x Dwarf (tt) â†’ All Tall (Tt) in F1.

---

### 2. The Law of Segregation

*   During gamete formation, two alleles for a character **segregate**, so each gamete receives only one allele.
*   **Example:** Tt plant produces T and t gametes.

---

### 3. The Law of Independent Assortment

*   Alleles for different traits are sorted independently of one another.
*   Inheritance of one trait does not affect another.
*   **Example:** Seed shape inheritance is independent of seed color inheritance.

---

## Genetic Crosses

### Monohybrid Cross

*   Cross between individuals differing in a single gene.
*   **Example:** TT x tt
    *   **F1:** All Tt (heterozygous tall).
    *   **F2 (Tt x Tt):**
        *   **Phenotypic Ratio:** 3 Tall : 1 Dwarf (3:1).
        *   **Genotypic Ratio:** 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt (1:2:1).

---

### Dihybrid Cross

*   Cross between individuals differing in two distinct genes.
*   **Example:** RRYY x rryy
    *   **F1:** All RrYy (round yellow).
    *   **F2 (RrYy x RrYy):**
        *   **Phenotypic Ratio:** 9 Round Yellow : 3 Round Green : 3 Wrinkled Yellow : 1 Wrinkled Green (9:3:3:1).

## Key Genetic Terminology

*   **Gene:** Basic physical and functional unit of heredity (DNA sequence).
*   **Allele:** Alternative form of a gene.
*   **Homozygous:** Two identical alleles (TT, tt).
*   **Heterozygous:** Two different alleles (Tt).
*   **Dominant:** Allele expressed phenotypically, masks recessive.
*   **Recessive:** Allele masked by dominant, expressed only in homozygous state.
*   **Mutation:** Permanent alteration in DNA sequence.
*   **Variation:** Differences between individuals (genotypic or environmental).
*   **Phenotype:** Observable characteristics (e.g., tall, dwarf).
*   **Genotype:** Genetic makeup (e.g., TT, Tt, tt).

---

## Sex Determination in Humans

*   Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
*   **Autosomes:** 22 pairs (same in males/females).
*   **Sex Chromosomes:** 23rd pair, determine sex.
    *   **Females:** XX.
    *   **Males:** XY.
*   Sex of child determined by sperm (X or Y).

---

## Sex-Linked Inheritance of Diseases

*   Traits inherited through X or Y chromosomes (mostly X-linked).

---

### X-linked Diseases

*   Males (one X) more likely to be affected by X-linked recessive disorders.
*   Females (two X) can be carriers.

---

#### 1. Haemophilia

*   **Description:** Blood does not clot properly (lack of clotting proteins).
*   **Inheritance:** X-linked recessive. More common in males.

---

#### 2. Colour Blindness

*   **Description:** Inability to see color (most common: red-green).
*   **Inheritance:** X-linked recessive. Much more common in males.
