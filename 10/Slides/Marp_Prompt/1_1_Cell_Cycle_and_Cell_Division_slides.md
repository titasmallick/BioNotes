# Cell Cycle and Cell Division

## Introduction to the Cell Cycle

---

## The Two Main Phases of the Cell Cycle

1.  **Interphase:** Longest phase, cell grows, carries out functions, prepares for division.
2.  **Mitotic Phase (M Phase):** Actual cell division (mitosis + cytokinesis).

---

## Interphase: The Preparatory Stage

*   Period of intense growth and preparation.

---

### G1 (Gap 1) Phase: The Growth Phase

*   Cell grows significantly in size.
*   Synthesizes new proteins, organelles, mRNA.
*   High metabolic activity.

---

### S (Synthesis) Phase: DNA Replication

*   **DNA replication:** Cell makes exact copy of chromosomes.
*   Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids.

---

### G2 (Gap 2) Phase: Final Preparations

*   Cell continues to grow.
*   Synthesizes proteins for mitosis.
*   Checks duplicated chromosomes for errors.

---

## Mitosis: The Division of the Nucleus

*   Nucleus divides, resulting in two genetically identical daughter nuclei.
*   Continuous process, divided into four stages.

---

### 1. Prophase: The Condensation

*   Chromatin condenses into visible, compact chromosomes (two sister chromatids).
*   Nuclear envelope disintegrates.
*   Mitotic spindle begins to form.

---

### 2. Metaphase: The Alignment

*   Chromosomes line up along the **metaphase plate** (center of the cell).
*   Ensures equal distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells.

---

### 3. Anaphase: The Separation

*   Centromeres divide, sister chromatids separate.
*   Individual chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell.

---

### 4. Telophase: The Reformation

*   Complete sets of chromosomes arrive at each pole.
*   New nuclear envelope forms around each set.
*   Chromosomes decondense.
*   **Cytokinesis** (cytoplasm division) usually begins.

---

## Meiosis: The Reduction Division

*   Specialized cell division in sexually reproducing organisms.
*   Reduces chromosome number by half.
*   Produces four haploid daughter cells (gametes).

---

### Homologous Chromosomes and Crossing Over

*   **Homologous Chromosomes:** Pairs of chromosomes (one maternal, one paternal).
*   **Crossing Over:** Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I.
    *   Creates new combinations of alleles.

---

### Significance of Crossing Over

*   Major source of **genetic variation** in a species.
*   Raw material for evolution by natural selection.

## Significance and Major Differences Between Mitosis and Meiosis

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Growth, repair, asexual reproduction | Production of gametes for sexual reproduction |
| **Number of Divisions** | One | Two (Meiosis I and Meiosis II) |
| **Number of Daughter Cells** | Two | Four |
| **Chromosome Number** | Diploid (2n), identical to parent | Haploid (n), genetically different |
| **Genetic Variation** | Does not introduce | Introduces (crossing over) |
| **Pairing of Homologous Chromosomes** | Does not occur | Occurs during Prophase I |

---

*   Mitosis: Creates identical cell copies for growth and healing.
*   Meiosis: Creates unique gametes for genetic diversity in next generation.
