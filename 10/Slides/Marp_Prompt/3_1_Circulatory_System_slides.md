# Circulatory System

---

## Blood

*   Specialized bodily fluid.
*   Transports nutrients, oxygen, hormones, waste.
*   Composed of plasma, RBCs, WBCs, platelets.

---

### Composition of Blood

*   **Plasma (55%):** Yellowish fluid, carries cells, nutrients, hormones, waste.
*   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs/Erythrocytes):** Most numerous.
    *   **Structure:** Biconcave discs, anucleated (mammals).
    *   **Function:** Transport oxygen (via hemoglobin).
    *   Absence of nucleus/organelles increases efficiency.
*   **White Blood Cells (WBCs/Leukocytes):** Crucial for immune system, fight infections.
*   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Cell fragments, vital for blood clotting.

---

### Blood Coagulation

*   Process of blood changing from liquid to gel (clot).
*   Prevents excessive bleeding.
*   Cascade of enzymatic reactions involving clotting factors.
*   Forms fibrin mesh, trapping platelets and RBCs.

---

### Tissue Fluid and Lymph

*   **Tissue Fluid (Interstitial Fluid):** Surrounds cells, formed from plasma leaking from capillaries.
    *   Brings O₂/nutrients to cells, removes waste.
*   **Lymph:** Tissue fluid entering lymphatic vessels.
    *   Clear fluid, contains WBCs, circulates in lymphatic system.
    *   Crucial for immune response.

---

## The Heart

*   Muscular organ, pumps blood throughout body.
*   Central component of circulatory system.

---

### Structure of the Heart

*   Four chambers:
    *   **Two Atria:** Upper chambers, receive blood.
    *   **Two Ventricles:** Lower chambers, pump blood out.
*   Right side: Deoxygenated blood.
*   Left side: Oxygenated blood.
*   **Valves:** Ensure unidirectional blood flow.

---

### Working of the Heart and Circulation

*   **Cardiac Cycle:** Sequential events of heart contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole).
*   **Systole:** Heart muscle contracts, pumps blood.
*   **Diastole:** Heart muscle relaxes, chambers fill with blood.

---

### Double Circulation

*   Blood passes through heart twice per body circuit (mammals).
1.  **Pulmonary Circulation:** Right ventricle → lungs (oxygenated) → left atrium.
2.  **Systemic Circulation:** Left ventricle → body (deoxygenated) → right atrium.

---

### Main Blood Vessels (Entering/Leaving Heart)

*   **Entering Heart:**
    *   **Vena Cava:** Deoxygenated blood from body to right atrium.
    *   **Pulmonary Veins:** Oxygenated blood from lungs to left atrium.
*   **Leaving Heart:**
    *   **Pulmonary Artery:** Deoxygenated blood from right ventricle to lungs.
    *   **Aorta:** Oxygenated blood from left ventricle to body.

---

### Main Blood Vessels (Liver/Kidneys)

*   **To/from Liver:**
    *   **Hepatic Artery:** Oxygenated blood to liver.
    *   **Hepatic Vein:** Deoxygenated blood from liver to vena cava.
    *   **Hepatic Portal Vein:** Nutrient-rich blood from digestive system to liver.
*   **To/from Kidneys:**
    *   **Renal Artery:** Oxygenated blood to kidneys.
    *   **Renal Vein:** Deoxygenated blood from kidneys to vena cava.

---

### Pulse and Blood Pressure

*   **Pulse:** Rhythmic expansion/recoil of arteries due to heart contraction.
*   **Blood Pressure (BP):** Pressure of circulating blood on vessel walls.
    *   **Systolic Pressure:** During heart contraction.
    *   **Diastolic Pressure:** During heart relaxation.

---

## Blood Vessels

*   Channels for blood circulation.
*   **Arteries:** Thick-walled, muscular, carry blood *away* from heart (high pressure).
*   **Veins:** Thinner-walled, carry blood *towards* heart (lower pressure), have valves.
*   **Capillaries:** Smallest, thin-walled, network for exchange of gases, nutrients, waste.

---

## Lymphatic System

*   Network of tissues/organs.
*   Transports lymph (fluid with WBCs) throughout body.
*   Rids body of toxins, waste.

---

### Lymphatic Organs

*   **Spleen:** Largest lymphatic organ. Filters blood, stores WBCs, recycles old RBCs.
*   **Tonsils:** Lymphatic tissue in throat, fight infections.

---

## Blood Groups

*   Determined by presence/absence of specific antigens on RBC surface.

---

### ABO Blood Group System

*   **Type A:** A antigens, anti-B antibodies.
*   **Type B:** B antigens, anti-A antibodies.
*   **Type AB:** A and B antigens, no antibodies (Universal Recipient).
*   **Type O:** No antigens, anti-A and anti-B antibodies (Universal Donor).

---

### Rh Factor

*   Another antigen on RBC surface.
*   **Rh-positive (Rh+):** Has Rh antigen.
*   **Rh-negative (Rh-):** Lacks Rh antigen.
*   Important in pregnancy (Erythroblastosis fetalis).

---

## Hepatic Portal System

*   Veins carrying blood from stomach, intestines, spleen, pancreas to liver.
*   Liver processes absorbed nutrients before distribution to body.
*   Detoxifies harmful substances.
