# Pollution

*   Introduction of harmful materials (pollutants) into the environment.
*   Pollutants can be natural (volcanic ash) or human-made (trash, factory runoff).
*   Damages quality of air, water, and land.

---

## (i) Types and Sources of Pollution; Major Pollutants

### Air Pollution

*   Contamination of air by harmful substances.
*   **Sources and Pollutants:**
    *   **Vehicular:** CO, NOx, hydrocarbons, particulate matter.
    *   **Industrial:** SO2, NOx, particulate matter.
    *   **Burning Garbage:** Smoke, ash, dioxins, furans.
    *   **Brick Kilns:** Black carbon, SO2, particulate matter.

---

### Water Pollution

*   Contamination of water bodies, usually from human activities.
*   **Sources and Pollutants:**
    *   **Household Detergents:** Phosphates (eutrophication).
    *   **Sewage:** Untreated or inadequately treated sewage contains organic matter, bacteria, and viruses.
    *   **Industrial Waste:** Heavy metals (lead, mercury), chemicals, solvents.
    *   **Oil Spills:** Devastating effects on marine life.

---

### Thermal Pollution

*   Degradation of water quality by changing its temperature.
*   **Common Cause:** Use of water as coolant by power plants/industries.

---

### Soil Pollution

*   Contamination of soil with harmful substances.
*   **Sources and Pollutants:**
    *   **Industrial Waste:** Toxic chemicals.
    *   **Urban Waste:** Garbage.
    *   **Chemical Fertilizers and Pesticides:** Excessive use of these chemicals in agriculture can degrade soil quality and contaminate groundwater.

---

### Biomedical Waste

*   Waste containing infectious (or potentially infectious) materials.
*   **Examples:** Used needles, syringes, soiled dressings, body parts, diagnostic samples, pharmaceuticals, radioactive materials.

---

### Radiation Pollution

*   Increase in natural radiation levels due to human activities.
*   **Sources:**
    *   **X-rays:** Medical and dental.
    *   **Radioactive Fallout:** From nuclear plants (accidents).

---

### Noise Pollution

*   Disturbing or excessive noise harming human/animal life.
*   **Sources:**
    *   **Motor Vehicles:** Traffic noise.
    *   **Industrial Establishments:** Machinery noise.
    *   **Construction Sites:** Drilling, excavation.
    *   **Loudspeakers:** Public events, religious gatherings.

---

## (ii) Biodegradable and Non-biodegradable Wastes

### Biodegradable Wastes

*   **Meaning:** Can be broken down by microorganisms into simpler, harmless substances.
*   **Examples:** Paper, vegetable peels, food scraps, wood, cotton.

---

### Non-biodegradable Wastes

*   **Meaning:** Cannot be broken down by microorganisms, persist in environment for long time.
*   **Examples:** Plastics, glass, Styrofoam, synthetic fibers, DDT.

---

## (iii) Effects of Pollution and Control Measures

### Effects of Pollution

*   **Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming:** Trapping of heat by greenhouse gases (CO₂), leading to increased Earth temperature, climate change, rising sea levels.
*   **Acid Rain:** Pollutants (SO₂, NOx) react with water in atmosphere, form acids. Damages forests, soils, aquatic ecosystems.
*   **Ozone Layer Depletion:** Thinning of ozone layer (stratosphere) by CFCs. Ozone layer protects from harmful UV radiation.

---

### Measures to Control Pollution

*   **Use of Unleaded Petrol / CNG:** Reduces harmful emissions from vehicles.
*   **Switching off Engines at Traffic Signals:** Reduces fuel consumption and air pollution.
*   **Social Forestry:** Large-scale tree planting (absorbs CO₂).
*   **Setting up Sewage Treatment Plants:** Reduces water pollution.
*   **Ban on Polythene and Plastics:** Reduces plastic pollution.
*   **Organic Farming:** Reduces soil/water pollution from chemicals.
*   **Euro/Bharat Vehicular Standards:** Stricter emission standards for vehicles.

### Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

*   National campaign by Government of India (2014).
*   Aims to clean streets, roads, infrastructure in cities, towns, rural areas.
*   Vision of a 'Clean India'.
