## Endocrine vs. Exocrine Glands

| Feature | Endocrine Glands | Exocrine Glands |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ducts** | Ductless; secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. | Have ducts to carry secretions to a specific location. |
| **Secretions** | Hormones | Enzymes, sweat, saliva, etc. |
| **Target** | Act on distant target cells or organs. | Act locally at the site of secretion. |
| **Examples** | Pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands | Salivary, sweat, and sebaceous glands |

## Major Endocrine Glands

### 1. Adrenal Gland

*   **Location:** A pair of pyramid-shaped glands located on top of each kidney.
*   **Hormones Secreted:**
    *   **Adrenal Cortex (Outer Part):**
        *   **Glucocorticoids (e.g., Cortisol):** Regulate metabolism, suppress inflammation, and help the body respond to stress.
        *   **Mineralocorticoids (e.g., Aldosterone):** Control the balance of water and salts in the body.
    *   **Adrenal Medulla (Inner Part):**
        *   **Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine):** Responsible for the "fight or flight" response, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

---

### 2. Pancreas

*   **Location:** A long, flat gland located behind the stomach.
*   **Hormones Secreted (from the Islets of Langerhans):**
    *   **Insulin:** Lowers blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells.
    *   **Glucagon:** Raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose.

---

### 3. Thyroid Gland

*   **Location:** A butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, in front of the trachea.
*   **Hormones Secreted:**
    *   **Thyroxine (T4):** The main hormone produced by the thyroid. It regulates the body's metabolic rate.

---

### 4. Pituitary Gland

*   **Location:** A pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain.
*   **Hormones Secreted:**
    *   **Anterior Pituitary:**
        *   **Growth Hormone (GH):** Stimulates growth.
        *   **Tropic Hormones:** Hormones that control the function of other endocrine glands (TSH, ACTH).
    *   **Posterior Pituitary:**
        *   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** Regulates water balance.
        *   **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions, milk release.

## Hormonal Imbalances

| Gland | Hormone | Hyposecretion (Too Little) | Hypersecretion (Too Much) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pancreas** | Insulin | **Hyperglycemia (Diabetes Mellitus)** | **Hypoglycemia** |
| **Thyroid** | Thyroxine | **Hypothyroidism** (slow metabolism, weight gain, fatigue) | **Hyperthyroidism** (rapid metabolism, weight loss, nervousness) |
| **Adrenal** | Cortisol | **Addison's Disease** | **Cushing's Syndrome** |
| **Pituitary** | Growth Hormone | **Dwarfism** (children) | **Gigantism** (children); **Acromegaly** (adults) |

## Feedback Mechanism: TSH

*   Endocrine system regulated by feedback to maintain homeostasis.
*   **Negative Feedback Loop (Thyroxine):**
    1.  **Hypothalamus** releases TRH.
    2.  TRH stimulates **pituitary gland** to release TSH.
    3.  TSH stimulates **thyroid gland** to produce thyroxine.
    4.  High thyroxine levels inhibit TRH and TSH release, reducing thyroxine production.
*   Ensures stable thyroxine levels.
