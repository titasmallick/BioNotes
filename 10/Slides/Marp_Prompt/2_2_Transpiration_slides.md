# Plant Physiology: Transpiration

---

## 1. Concept and Importance of Transpiration

*   **Transpiration:** Release of water vapor from aerial parts of plants (primarily leaves via stomata).
*   Evaporation of water from plant leaves.

---

### 1.1. Process of Transpiration

1.  **Water Absorption:** Roots absorb water, transported upwards via xylem.
2.  **Movement to Leaves:** Water travels to mesophyll cells.
3.  **Evaporation:** Water evaporates from mesophyll cell surfaces into air spaces.
4.  **Diffusion through Stomata:** Water vapor diffuses out of leaf through stomata.

---

### 1.2. Significance of Transpiration

*   **Creation of Transpirational Pull:** Evaporation creates tension in xylem, pulling water upwards (primary force for ascent of sap).
*   **Transport of Minerals:** Transpiration stream carries dissolved minerals.
*   **Cooling Effect:** Evaporation absorbs latent heat, cooling the plant.
*   **Maintenance of Turgor Pressure:** Helps maintain cell turgidity, essential for plant form and stomatal movement.

## 2. Ganong’s Potometer and its Limitations

*   Apparatus to measure water uptake by leafy shoot (assumed equal to transpiration).
*   Works by measuring movement of an air bubble in a capillary tube.

---

### 2.1. How it Works

1.  Leafy shoot cut under water, inserted into potometer.
2.  Apparatus filled with water, air bubble introduced.
3.  As plant transpires, water drawn, air bubble moves.

---

### 2.2. Limitations of Ganong’s Potometer

*   Measures water uptake, not transpiration directly.
*   Requires airtight seal.
*   Cutting shoot can damage xylem.
*   Sensitive to environmental factors.
*   Air bubble issues (stuck, dissolves).

---

## 3. Factors Affecting the Rate of Transpiration

### 3.1. Environmental Factors

*   **Light Intensity:** Increases transpiration (promotes stomatal opening, raises leaf temp).
*   **Temperature:** Higher temp increases evaporation/diffusion.
*   **Humidity:** High humidity reduces transpiration (reduces water potential gradient).
*   **Wind Speed:** Higher wind speed increases transpiration (removes humid air layer).
*   **Atmospheric Pressure:** Lower pressure slightly increases transpiration.
*   **Availability of Soil Water:** Scarcity reduces transpiration (stomata close).

---

### 3.2. Plant Factors

*   **Stomatal Density and Distribution:** Higher density/stomata on both surfaces = more transpiration.
*   **Leaf Area:** Larger leaf area = higher transpiration.
*   **Cuticle Thickness:** Thicker cuticle reduces cuticular transpiration.
*   **Root-to-Shoot Ratio:** Larger root system supports higher transpiration.
*   **Leaf Orientation:** Avoid direct sunlight = less transpiration.

---

## 4. Experiments on Transpiration

### 4.1. Loss in Weight of a Potted Plant or a Leafy Shoot

*   **Aim:** Demonstrate water loss through transpiration.
*   **Procedure:** Weigh potted plant (soil covered), place in light, reweigh. Or, leafy shoot in test tube with oil layer, observe water level.
*   **Observation:** Weight/water level decreases.

---

### 4.2. Use of Cobalt Chloride Paper

*   **Aim:** Demonstrate unequal rates of transpiration in a dorsiventral leaf.
*   **Procedure:** Place dry blue cobalt chloride papers on upper and lower surfaces of leaf.
*   **Observation:** Paper on lower surface turns pink faster (higher stomata density).

---

## 5. Mechanism of Stomatal Transpiration: Potassium Ion Exchange Theory

*   Stomatal opening/closing controlled by guard cell turgor pressure.

---

### 5.1. Stomatal Opening

1.  **Light Stimulus:** Guard cells photosynthesize, produce ATP.
2.  **K+ Influx:** ATP powers H+-ATPases, H+ pumped out. Negative membrane potential activates K+ channels, K+ influx.
3.  **Water Potential Decrease:** K+ accumulation lowers guard cell water potential.
4.  **Water Influx:** Water moves by osmosis into guard cells, increasing turgor.
5.  **Stomatal Opening:** Guard cells bow outwards due to differential wall thickening.

---

### 5.2. Stomatal Closing

1.  **Absence of Light/Stress:** ABA produced.
2.  **K+ Efflux:** ABA triggers K+ efflux.
3.  **Water Potential Increase:** Solute loss increases guard cell water potential.
4.  **Water Efflux:** Water moves out by osmosis, guard cells lose turgor.
5.  **Stomatal Closing:** Guard cells straighten, closing pore.

---

## 6. Adaptations in Plants to Reduce Transpiration

*   **Thick Cuticle:** Reduces evaporation.
*   **Sunken Stomata:** Stomata in pits (humid microenvironment).
*   **Hairy Leaves (Trichomes):** Trap moist air.
*   **Rolled Leaves:** Reduce exposed surface area.
*   **Reduced Leaf Surface Area:** Small/needle-like leaves, spines.
*   **Succulence:** Fleshy stems/leaves store water.
*   **CAM Photosynthesis:** Stomata open at night.
*   **Deep Root Systems:** Access deeper water.
*   **Shedding Leaves:** Deciduous plants during dry seasons.

---

## 7. Guttation and Bleeding

*   Distinct from transpiration.

---

### 7.1. Guttation

*   Exudation of xylem sap drops from leaf tips/edges.
*   Occurs when root pressure is high, transpiration low (e.g., at night).
*   Through **hydathodes**.
*   Contains dissolved minerals/sugars (unlike dew).

---

### 7.2. Bleeding

*   Exudation of xylem sap from a cut or injured plant part.
*   Driven by root pressure.
*   Demonstrates root pressure and continuous sap movement.
