# The Nervous System

---

## Structure of a Neuron

*   Fundamental unit of nervous system.
*   **Cell Body (Soma/Cyton):** Main part, nucleus, metabolic center.
*   **Dendrites:** Short, branched, receive signals *towards* cell body.
*   **Axon:** Long, slender, carries impulses *away* from cell body.
*   **Myelin Sheath:** Fatty insulation (Schwann cells), with **Nodes of Ranvier**. Increases speed (saltatory conduction).
*   **Axon Terminals:** Branched endings, contain synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters.

---

## Divisions of the Nervous System

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

*   Body's command center.
*   Consists of **brain** and **spinal cord**.

---

#### The Brain

*   Primary control center.
*   **Cerebrum:** Largest part, two hemispheres. Intelligence, memory, consciousness, voluntary actions.
*   **Cerebellum:** Back of brain. Coordinates voluntary movements, posture, balance.
*   **Medulla Oblongata:** Brainstem. Controls vital involuntary functions (heartbeat, breathing, BP).
*   **Thalamus:** Relay station for sensory information.
*   **Hypothalamus:** Regulates body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep-wake, controls pituitary.
*   **Pons:** Brainstem. Relays signals, role in sleep/arousal.

---

#### Gray and White Matter (in CNS)

*   **Gray Matter:** Neuron cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons. (Outer layer of brain, central H-shaped core of spinal cord).
*   **White Matter:** Myelinated axons. (Beneath cortex in brain, surrounds gray matter in spinal cord).

---

#### The Spinal Cord

*   Long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue.
*   Extends from medulla oblongata.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Pathway for nerve impulses to/from brain.
    *   Center for coordinating many reflexes.

---

### Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

*   Nerves branching from brain and spinal cord.
*   Connects CNS to rest of body.
*   **Somatic Nervous System:** Sensory and motor info to/from CNS. Voluntary control of skeletal muscles.
*   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Regulates involuntary functions (heart rate, digestion).
    *   **Sympathetic:** "Fight or flight."
    *   **Parasympathetic:** "Rest and digest."

---

## Actions: Voluntary and Involuntary

*   **Voluntary Actions:** Under conscious control (walking, talking). Initiated by cerebrum.
*   **Involuntary Actions:** Not under conscious control (heartbeat, digestion). Controlled by ANS.

---

### Reflex Action

*   Rapid, involuntary, stereotyped response to a stimulus.
*   Protective mechanism.
*   **Reflex Arc:** Neural pathway mediating reflex.
    1.  **Receptor:** Detects stimulus.
    2.  **Sensory Neuron:** Transmits impulse to CNS.
    3.  **Interneuron:** Processes signal in CNS.
    4.  **Motor Neuron:** Carries impulse to effector.
    5.  **Effector:** Muscle/gland responds.

---

### Types of Reflexes

*   **Natural (Innate) Reflexes:** Present from birth (sneezing, blinking).
*   **Acquired (Conditioned) Reflexes:** Learned through experience (salivating at food sight).

---

## Sense Organs

### The Eye

*   Organ of sight.

---

#### Structure and Function (Eye)

*   **Cornea:** Transparent outer layer, refracts light.
*   **Iris:** Colored part, controls pupil size.
*   **Pupil:** Opening in iris, allows light entry.
*   **Lens:** Transparent, focuses light onto retina.
*   **Retina:** Light-sensitive layer, contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones).
*   **Optic Nerve:** Transmits visual info to brain.

---

#### Vision

*   **Accommodation:** Eye changes lens shape to focus at different distances.
*   **Adaptation:** Eye adjusts to different light levels.
*   **Stereoscopic Vision:** Perceive depth from two slightly different images.

---

#### Defects of the Eye and Corrective Measures

*   **Myopia (Nearsightedness):** Focuses in front of retina. Corrected with concave lens.
*   **Hyperopia (Farsightedness):** Focuses behind retina. Corrected with convex lens.
*   **Presbyopia:** Age-related loss of accommodation. Corrected with bifocal/progressive lenses.
*   **Astigmatism:** Irregular cornea shape. Corrected with cylindrical lens.
*   **Cataract:** Cloudy lens. Corrected by surgical replacement.

---

### The Ear

*   Organ of hearing and balance.

---

#### Parts and Functions (Ear)

*   **Outer Ear:** Pinna (collects sound), Auditory Canal (directs sound).
*   **Middle Ear:** Tympanic Membrane (eardrum, vibrates), Ossicles (Malleus, Incus, Stapes - amplify/transmit vibrations).
*   **Inner Ear:** Cochlea (converts sound to nerve impulses), Vestibular System (Semicircular Canals, Utricle, Saccule - balance/equilibrium).

---

#### Hearing and Balance

*   **Perception of Sound:** Sound waves → eardrum vibrates → ossicles amplify → cochlea converts to nerve impulses → auditory nerve to brain.
*   **Role in Balance:** Vestibular system detects head position/movement, sends signals to brain.

---

## Nerve Impulse Transmission

*   Electrochemical process.
*   **Resting Potential:** -70mV, maintained by Na+/K+ pump.
*   **Action Potential ("All-or-None"):** Fires when stimulus reaches threshold (~-55mV).
*   **Depolarization:** Na+ influx, inside becomes positive.
*   **Repolarization:** K+ efflux, inside becomes negative again.
*   **Hyperpolarization:** Brief period, more negative than resting.
*   **Refractory Period:** Neuron cannot fire another action potential.
*   **Saltatory Conduction:** In myelinated neurons, impulse jumps between Nodes of Ranvier (faster).
*   **Synaptic Transmission:** Action potential triggers neurotransmitter release into synapse, binding to receptors on next neuron.
*   **Synaptic Delay:** Brief delay in transmission across synapse.
