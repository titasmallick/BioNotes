# Human Body – The Skeletal System

## Key Concepts

### Overview of the Skeletal System

*   Complex and vital framework.
*   Provides structure, protection, and enables movement.
*   Consists of bones, joints, and connective tissues (cartilage, ligaments, tendons).
*   Adult human skeleton: 206 bones (Axial and Appendicular).

---

### Major Bones

*   **Axial Skeleton (80 bones):** Central core, support, protects vital organs.
    *   **Skull:** Cranium, maxilla, mandible.
    *   **Spine (Vertebral Column):** 26 vertebrae.
    *   **Chest (Thorax):** Sternum, ribs.
*   **Appendicular Skeleton (126 bones):** Limbs and girdles (attach to axial).
    *   **Arms:** Clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges.
    *   **Pelvis:** Hip bones.
    *   **Legs:** Femur, patella, tibia, fibula, tarsals, metatarsals, phalanges.

---

### Bone Classification by Shape

*   **Long bones:** Limbs (femur, humerus).
*   **Short bones:** Wrists, ankles (carpals, tarsals).
*   **Flat bones:** Protection (skull, ribs, scapula).
*   **Irregular bones:** Complex shapes (vertebrae).
*   **Sesamoid bones:** Small, round, embedded in tendons (patella).

---

### Types of Joints

*   Points where two or more bones meet.
*   Classified by structure or function.

---

#### Classification by Structure

*   **Fibrous Joints:** Connected by thick connective tissue, little/no movement (e.g., skull sutures).
*   **Cartilaginous Joints:** Bones united by cartilage, limited movement (e.g., vertebrae).
*   **Synovial Joints:** Most common, fluid-filled capsule, wide range of motion.

---

#### Types of Synovial Joints

*   **Hinge joints:** Movement in one direction (e.g., knees, elbows).
*   **Ball and socket joints:** Rotation and movement in almost any direction (e.g., shoulders, hips).
*   **Condyloid joints:** Circular motion, flexion, and extension (e.g., wrist).
*   **Pivot joints:** Rotation around an axis (e.g., first/second vertebrae in neck).
*   **Planar (Gliding) joints:** Limited sliding movement (e.g., wrist, ankle bones).
*   **Saddle joints:** Movement back and forth and side to side, no rotation (e.g., base of thumb).

---

#### Classification by Function (Range of Motion)

*   **Synarthroses (Immovable):** Structural support (e.g., skull sutures).
*   **Amphiarthroses (Slightly Movable):** Offer a mix of stability and some motion (e.g., vertebrae).
*   **Diarthroses (Freely Movable):** Allow the most movement (e.g., most synovial joints).

---

### Functions of Bones and Joints

*   **Support:** Provides body's shape and support.
*   **Movement:** Bones are levers, joints facilitate movement.
*   **Protection:** Protects internal organs.
*   **Mineral and Fat Storage:** Reservoir for calcium, phosphorus, and fat.
*   **Blood Cell Production (Hematopoiesis):** Bone marrow produces blood cells.

---

### Importance of Good Posture

*   Natural way to hold body, minimizes strain.
*   Reduces aches and pains (back, neck, shoulder).
*   Prevents injuries.
*   Improves spine health.
*   Reduces wear and tear on joints.
*   Increases energy levels.
*   Enhances confidence.
*   Better muscle and joint function.

---

### Role of Calcium-Rich Foods

*   Calcium is crucial for strong bones.
*   **Sources:** Dairy products, leafy green vegetables, fish with edible bones, fortified foods, legumes, nuts.
*   **Vitamin D:** Essential for calcium absorption (from sunlight, oily fish).

---

### Exercises to Strengthen Bones and Muscles

*   **Weight-Bearing Impact Exercises:** Work against gravity, put pressure on bones (e.g., walking, running, dancing, climbing stairs).
*   **Muscle-Strengthening (Resistance) Exercises:** Build muscle strength, stimulate bone growth (e.g., weightlifting, bodyweight exercises).
*   **Balance Training:** Prevents falls (e.g., Yoga).
*   Variety in exercise is beneficial.

---

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Draw major bones and joints.
*   Observe skeleton models/charts.
*   Perform posture exercises.
*   Identify calcium-rich foods, discuss Vitamin D.
*   Research common bone and joint conditions.
