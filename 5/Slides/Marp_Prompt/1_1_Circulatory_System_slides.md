# Human Body – The Circulatory System

## Key Concepts

### Organs of the Circulatory System

*   Vital organ system for transporting blood, nutrients, oxygen, etc.
*   **Heart:** Muscular pump.
*   **Blood Vessels:** Network of tubes (Arteries, Veins, Capillaries).
*   **Blood:** Fluid carrying essential substances.

### Detailed Structure and Function of Organs

#### The Heart

*   Muscular, fist-sized organ, located slightly left of breastbone.
*   **Structure:** Four chambers.
    *   **Atria (Upper):** Right (receives deoxygenated from body), Left (receives oxygenated from lungs).
    *   **Ventricles (Lower):** Right (pumps deoxygenated to lungs), Left (pumps oxygenated to body - strongest chamber).
*   **Valves:** Ensure unidirectional blood flow (Tricuspid, Mitral/Bicuspid, Pulmonary, Aortic).
*   **Heart Wall Layers:** Epicardium (outer), Myocardium (middle, muscular), Endocardium (inner, smooth).
*   **Function:** Beats in a two-phase cycle: Diastole (relax, fill), Systole (contract, pump).

---

#### Arteries

*   Carry blood *away* from the heart (mostly oxygenated, except pulmonary artery).
*   **Structure:** Thick, muscular, elastic walls (Tunica Intima, Tunica Media, Tunica Externa).
*   **Function:** Transport high-pressure blood, regulate pressure, vasoconstriction/vasodilation.

---

#### Veins

*   Carry blood *back* to the heart (mostly deoxygenated, except pulmonary veins).
*   **Structure:** Thinner, less muscular/elastic walls than arteries.
*   **Valves:** One-way valves prevent backflow (especially in limbs).
*   **Function:** Collect deoxygenated blood, operate under lower pressure, assisted flow by muscle contractions.

---

#### Capillaries

*   Smallest and most numerous blood vessels.
*   Connect arterioles and venules.
*   **Structure:** Extremely thin walls (one cell thick).
*   **Function:** Primary site for exchange of oxygen, nutrients, hormones, waste products between blood and tissues.
*   **Large Surface Area:** For efficient diffusion.

---

### Functions of Blood

*   **Transport:** Oxygen, nutrients, waste products, hormones.
*   **Protection:** Fights infections (WBCs, antibodies), clotting prevents blood loss.
*   **Regulation:** Body temperature, pH balance.

### Process of Blood Circulation (Detailed)

*   Closed loop, two main circuits.
1.  **Pulmonary Circulation:**
    *   Deoxygenated blood: Right atrium → Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs.
    *   Oxygenated blood: Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium.
2.  **Systemic Circulation:**
    *   Oxygenated blood: Left atrium → Left ventricle → Aorta → Arteries → Arterioles → Capillaries (body tissues).
    *   Deoxygenated blood: Capillaries → Venules → Veins → Vena Cava (superior/inferior) → Right atrium.

### Differences between Arteries and Veins

| Feature | Arteries | Veins |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Blood Flow** | Away from the heart | Towards the heart |
| **Oxygen Content** | Mostly oxygen-rich (except pulmonary artery) | Mostly oxygen-poor (except pulmonary vein) |
| **Wall Thickness** | Thick, muscular, elastic | Thin, less muscular, less elastic |
| **Valves** | Absent (except at heart exit) | Present (especially in limbs) |
| **Blood Pressure** | High | Low |
| **Lumen Size** | Narrower | Wider |

### Keeping the Heart Healthy through Simple Exercises and Yoga

*   **Regular Aerobic Exercise:** Strengthens heart, improves circulation, lowers BP, reduces bad cholesterol, increases good cholesterol, maintains healthy weight.
*   **Strength Training:** Benefits heart health by building muscle mass.
*   **Yoga and Pranayama (Deep Breathing):** Reduce stress, lower BP, improve lung capacity, promote cardiovascular health.

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Draw and label circulatory organs.
*   Observe models and charts.
*   Discuss impact of lifestyle choices.
*   Practice deep breathing exercises.
*   Research cardiovascular diseases.
