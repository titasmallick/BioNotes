# Pollination

## Key Concepts

### Detailed Parts of a Flower

*   **Vegetative Parts:**
    *   **Peduncle:** Stalk supporting flower.
    *   **Receptacle:** Flower stalk part where other parts attach.
    *   **Sepals (Calyx):** Outermost, protect bud.
    *   **Petals (Corolla):** Brightly colored, attract pollinators.
*   **Reproductive Parts:**
    *   **Stamen (Androecium):** Male organ (anther, filament), produces pollen.
    *   **Pistil/Carpel (Gynoecium):** Female organ (stigma, style, ovary), contains ovules.

### Detailed Pollination Process

*   Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma.
1.  **Pollen Transfer:** Pollen moves from anther to stigma (by wind, water, insects, etc.).
2.  **Pollen Germination:** Pollen absorbs moisture/nutrients, forms pollen tube.
3.  **Fertilization:** Pollen tube carries male gametes to ovule, male and female gametes fuse.
4.  **Seed and Fruit Development:** Ovule develops into seed, ovary into fruit.

### Types of Pollination

1.  **Self-Pollination:** Pollen transferred to stigma of **same flower** or another flower on **same plant**.
    *   **Autogamy:** Same flower (e.g., peas).
    *   **Geitonogamy:** Another flower on same plant (e.g., maize).
2.  **Cross-Pollination (Xenogamy):** Pollen transferred to stigma of flower on **different plant of same species**. Increases genetic diversity.

### Agents of Cross-Pollination

*   **Biotic Agents (Zoophily):** Animals.
    *   **Entomophily (Insect Pollination):** Bees, butterflies (brightly colored, fragrant, nectar-producing flowers).
    *   **Ornithophily (Bird Pollination):** Hummingbirds (bright, nectar-rich, tubular flowers).
    *   **Chiropterophily (Bat Pollination).**
*   **Abiotic Agents:** Non-living factors.
    *   **Anemophily (Wind Pollination):** Wind (small, less showy flowers, abundant light pollen).
    *   **Hydrophily (Water Pollination):** Water (less common).

### Bisexual and Unisexual Flowers

*   **Bisexual Flowers (Hermaphroditic/Complete):** Possess both male (stamens) and female (carpels) parts.
    *   **Examples:** Lily, Rose, Sunflower.
*   **Unisexual Flowers (Incomplete):** Contain either stamens or carpels, but not both.
    *   **Examples:** Papaya, Cucumber, Maize. Require cross-pollination.

### Importance of Pollination for Food Production and Biodiversity

*   **For Food Production:**
    *   **Crop Yields:** Pollinators essential for over 75% of flowering plants, including many food crops.
    *   **Economic Value:** Billions of dollars annually.
    *   **Dietary Diversity:** Provides micronutrients and vitamins.
*   **For Biodiversity:**
    *   **Ecosystem Health:** Critical for maintaining biodiversity (80%+ wild flowering plants pollinated by animals).
    *   **Plant Reproduction and Genetic Diversity:** Ensures reproduction and genetic diversity for adaptation.
    *   **Habitat and Food for Wildlife:** Supports ecosystem resilience.

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Observe and draw flower parts.
*   Identify pollen transfer types.
*   Discuss pollination mechanisms.
*   Research pollinator decline.
