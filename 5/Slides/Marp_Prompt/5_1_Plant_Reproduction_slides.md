# Plant Reproduction

## Key Concepts

### Sexual Reproduction and Fertilization

*   Production and fusion of male and female gametes.
*   Leads to offspring with genetic variation.
*   Primary organ in flowering plants: **flower**.

---

#### Flower Structure

*   **Male Reproductive Part (Stamen):** Anther (produces pollen), Filament (supports anther).
*   **Female Reproductive Part (Pistil/Carpel):** Stigma (receives pollen), Style (connects stigma to ovary), Ovary (contains ovules).

---

#### Pollination

*   Transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma.
*   **Self-Pollination:** Pollen transfer within same flower or same plant.
*   **Cross-Pollination:** Pollen transfer between different plants of same species.
*   **Pollinating Agents:** Wind, water, insects, animals.

---

#### Fertilization

*   Fusion of male and female gametes.
*   Pollen grain lands on stigma, germinates, grows pollen tube to ovule.
*   **Double Fertilization (Unique to Flowering Plants):**
    *   One sperm + egg cell → diploid zygote (embryo).
    *   Other sperm + two polar nuclei → triploid endosperm (nutritive tissue).

---

#### Seed and Fruit Formation

*   Ovule develops into **seed** (contains embryo and endosperm).
*   Ovary matures into **fruit** (encloses and protects seeds).

---

### Vegetative Reproduction Methods

*   Asexual reproduction: New plants from vegetative parts (stems, roots, leaves).
*   Offspring are genetically identical clones.

---

#### Natural Vegetative Propagation

*   **Runners (Stolons):** Horizontal stems, root at nodes (e.g., Strawberry).
*   **Rhizomes:** Underground horizontal stems (e.g., Ginger, Bamboo).
*   **Tubers:** Swollen underground stems/roots storing food (e.g., Potato, Sweet potato).
*   **Bulbs:** Short underground stems with fleshy leaves (e.g., Onion).
*   **Corms:** Swollen underground stem bases (e.g., Gladiolus).
*   **Plantlets:** Miniature plants on leaf margins (e.g., Kalanchoe).
*   **Suckers:** New shoots from roots/base of stem (e.g., Cherry trees).

---

#### Artificial Vegetative Propagation (Horticultural Methods)

*   **Cutting:** Section of plant (stem, leaf, root) planted to form new plant (e.g., Rose).
*   **Layering:** Stem/branch induced to root while attached to parent (e.g., Jasmine).
*   **Grafting:** Joining part of one plant (scion) onto another (rootstock) (e.g., Fruit trees).
*   **Tissue Culture (Micropropagation):** Growing new plants from small tissue pieces in sterile medium.

---

### Seed Dispersal Methods

*   Movement or transport of seeds away from parent plant.
*   Vital for survival and spread of plant species.

---

#### Types of Seed Dispersal

*   **Wind Dispersal (Anemochory):** Lightweight seeds, feathery/parachute-like structures, wings (e.g., Dandelion, Maple).
*   **Water Dispersal (Hydrochory):** Buoyant, waterproof seeds (e.g., Coconut, Water Lily).
*   **Animal Dispersal (Zoochory):**
    *   **External Attachment:** Hooks, barbs, sticky surfaces (e.g., Burdock).
    *   **Internal Dispersal (Endozoochory):** Fleshy fruits eaten, seeds pass through digestive system (e.g., Berries).
    *   **Caching/Hoarding:** Animals bury seeds (e.g., Acorns by squirrels).
    *   **Ant Dispersal (Myrmecochory):** Seeds with elaiosome attract ants.
*   **Gravity Dispersal (Barochory):** Heavy fruits/seeds fall and roll (e.g., Apples, Coconuts).
*   **Explosive Dispersal (Autochory/Ballistic):** Fruits burst open to scatter seeds (e.g., Pea pods, Okra).

---

### Importance of Seed Dispersal

*   **Reduces Competition:** Prevents overcrowding near parent plant.
*   **Colonization of New Areas:** Expands geographical range.
*   **Promotes Genetic Diversity:** Facilitates genetic mixing and variation.
*   **Avoids Predation and Disease:** Seeds escape density-dependent mortality.
*   **Maintains Ecosystem Health and Biodiversity.**

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Draw/label flower reproductive parts, illustrate double fertilization.
*   Visit nursery/botanical garden for vegetative propagation observation.
*   Collect/classify seeds by dispersal method.
*   Conduct germination experiments.
*   Propagate a plant using cuttings/layering.
*   Research ecological/evolutionary significance of seed dispersal.
