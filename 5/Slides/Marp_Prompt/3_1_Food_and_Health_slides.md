# Food and Health

## Key Concepts

### Components of a Balanced Diet

*   Provides all essential nutrients in right amounts for health, growth, and body function.
1.  **Carbohydrates:** Primary energy source (50-60% daily energy).
2.  **Proteins:** Growth, repair, immune function, hormones, enzymes (10-15% daily energy).
3.  **Fats (Lipids):** Cell membranes, hormones, fat-soluble vitamins, energy (20-30% daily energy).
4.  **Vitamins:** Micronutrients, regulate biochemical reactions.
5.  **Minerals:** Inorganic, bone health, nerve transmission, enzyme activity.
6.  **Water:** Crucial for life, solvent, transport, reactions.
*   **Fiber:** Essential for digestive health.

### Deficiency Diseases

*   Caused by lack of specific nutrients.
*   **Iron Deficiency Anemia:** Fatigue, pale skin.
*   **Vitamin A Deficiency:** Night blindness, xerophthalmia.
*   **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Rickets (children), Osteomalacia (adults).
*   **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Deficiency (Beriberi):** Weak muscles, weight loss.
*   **Vitamin B3 (Niacin) Deficiency (Pellagra):** Dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia.
*   **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:** Pernicious anemia, nerve issues.
*   **Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy):** Bleeding gums, fatigue.
*   **Iodine Deficiency:** Goiter, intellectual impairment.
*   **Protein Deficiency:** Kwashiorkor, Marasmus.

### Lifestyle Diseases

*   Linked to lifestyle choices and habits.
*   **Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs):** Heart attack, stroke, high BP (poor diet, sedentary, smoking).
*   **Type 2 Diabetes:** Insulin resistance (obesity, poor diet, inactivity).
*   **Obesity:** Excessive body fat (excess calories, inactivity).
*   **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):** Elevated BP (high salt, lack of exercise).
*   **Chronic Respiratory Diseases:** Asthma, COPD (pollutants, smoking).
*   **Certain Cancers:** (unhealthy diet, inactivity, tobacco/alcohol).
*   **Liver Diseases:** Fatty Liver, Cirrhosis (alcohol, unhealthy diets).
*   **Osteoporosis:** Weakening of bones (lack of Ca/Vit D, inactivity).
*   **Mental Health Disorders:** Depression, Anxiety (chronic stress, poor diet).

### Harmful Effects of Junk Food

*   High in fat, sugar, salt; lacks essential nutrients.
*   **Obesity and Weight Gain.**
*   **Increased Risk of Chronic Diseases:** Type 2 Diabetes, CVDs, kidney/liver damage, certain cancers.
*   **Nutritional Deficiencies.**
*   **Dental Problems.**
*   **Digestive Ailments.**
*   **Impact on Brain Function:** Poor concentration, fatigue.
*   **Mood and Energy Swings.**

### Benefits of Sprouted/Fermented Foods

*   **Sprouted Foods:** Germinated grains/beans/seeds.
    *   Increased nutrient content (protein, vitamins, minerals).
    *   Improved digestibility (enzymes break down complex molecules).
    *   Enhanced fiber content.
    *   Blood sugar regulation, heart health, weight management.
*   **Fermented Foods:** Controlled growth of microorganisms (bacteria, yeast).
    *   Improved gut health (probiotics).
    *   Enhanced nutrient availability (synthesize vitamins).
    *   Boosted immune system.
    *   Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
    *   Heart health, brain health, oral health.

### Food Adulteration (Detailed Awareness)

*   Deliberate contamination/substitution of food with inferior/harmful substances.
*   **Types:** Intentional (pebbles, chalk), Substitution (cheaper ingredients), Harmful substances (dyes, formalin), Masking spoilage, Accidental (pesticides).
*   **Harmful Effects:** Acute poisoning, organ damage (liver, kidney), neurological issues, cancer, nutritional deficiencies, GI disturbances, other chronic diseases.
    *   **Specific Adulterant Effects:** Formalin (asthma, cancer), Argemone seeds (epidemic dropsy), Lead Chromate (metal toxicity), Brick powder (stomach disorders), Urea (milk, kidney failure).

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Classify healthy vs. junk food.
*   Create food/nutrient charts.
*   Talk with health professionals.
*   Conduct community surveys on diet/health.
*   Research deficiency/lifestyle diseases, food adulteration.
