## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 Marks each) - Answers

1.  **Kwashiorkor** is caused by severe protein deficiency, leading to symptoms like swelling (edema) and pot belly. **Marasmus** is caused by severe deficiency of both protein and calories, resulting in severe wasting of muscles and fat, and a very thin body.
2.  Four components of a balanced diet are: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, and Vitamins.
3.  Symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency include difficulty seeing in dim light or at night (night blindness). In severe cases, it can lead to permanent blindness.
4.  Sprouted foods are considered healthy because the sprouting process increases their nutrient content (vitamins and minerals), makes them easier to digest, and improves the absorption of these nutrients by the body.
5.  Food adulteration is the act of intentionally debasing the quality of food by adding inferior or harmful substances. Two examples are adding water to milk and mixing stones in rice.
6.  Symptoms of anaemia include weakness, fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath.
7.  Junk food is harmful because it is high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and salt, leading to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of lifestyle diseases like diabetes and heart disease. It also lacks essential nutrients, causing deficiencies.
8.  Fermented foods are beneficial because they are rich in probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria. These probiotics improve gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and boost the body's immunity.
9.  Symptoms of rickets include soft and weak bones, leading to deformities like bowed legs. It can also cause delayed growth in children.
10. Hypertension is persistently high blood pressure. It is dangerous because it often has no obvious symptoms (silent killer) but can lead to serious long-term health problems like heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage if left untreated.
11. Symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, unexplained weight loss, and persistent fatigue.
12. Roughage, or fiber, is important in the diet because it aids in digestion by adding bulk to stool, which helps in regular bowel movements and prevents constipation. It also helps in maintaining a healthy digestive system.
13. Lifestyle diseases are conditions often linked to a person's lifestyle choices and habits rather than infectious agents. Two examples are obesity and diabetes.
14. Symptoms of scurvy include bleeding gums, general fatigue, and joint pain. It can also lead to poor wound healing.
15. Water is essential for all bodily functions. It transports nutrients, regulates body temperature, lubricates joints, and helps in the removal of waste products from the body.
16. Obesity is considered a health risk because excessive body fat accumulation significantly increases the risk of developing various serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer.
17. Symptoms of beriberi include general weakness, nerve damage (leading to tingling or numbness), and in severe cases, heart problems.
18. Probiotics are live microorganisms, primarily bacteria, that provide health benefits when consumed, especially for the digestive system. Their benefits include improving gut health, enhancing nutrient absorption, and boosting overall immunity.
19. Symptoms of goitre include a noticeable swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck. This swelling can sometimes lead to difficulty swallowing or breathing.
20. Proteins are crucial in the diet because they are essential for the growth and repair of body tissues. They also play a vital role in building muscles, and producing enzymes and hormones necessary for various bodily functions.
21. Iron deficiency leads to anaemia. The effects include weakness, persistent fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath due to the reduced ability of blood to carry oxygen.
22. Four harmful effects of food adulteration are: causing health problems (from mild digestive issues to severe poisoning), long-term diseases, loss of nutritional value in food, and economic fraud.
23. Including fruits and vegetables in the diet is beneficial because they are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They boost immunity, aid digestion, and help protect against various chronic diseases.
24. Symptoms of severe malnutrition include severe wasting of muscles and fat (marasmus), stunted growth, swelling (edema), and changes in hair and skin (kwashiorkor).
25. Vitamins play a crucial role in maintaining health by supporting various bodily functions. They are essential for growth, proper metabolism, immune system function, and preventing a wide range of deficiency diseases.

    *   **Roughage (Fiber):** Aids digestion and prevents constipation (e.g., whole grains).

2.  **Kwashiorkor** is a severe form of malnutrition caused by a chronic deficiency of protein, even when calorie intake might be adequate. It primarily affects children in developing countries. Its characteristic symptoms include generalized swelling (edema), particularly in the legs and face, a distended abdomen (pot belly), stunted growth, and changes in hair color and texture. The population most affected are young children, typically after weaning, when their diet lacks sufficient protein.

3.  **Food adulteration** is the deliberate act of debasing the quality of food by adding inferior, cheaper, or harmful substances, or by removing valuable components. Its harmful effects on health can range from mild digestive issues and allergic reactions to severe poisoning, organ damage, and long-term chronic diseases like cancer. Measures to prevent it include strict food safety regulations, regular inspections by authorities, consumer awareness campaigns, and promoting ethical practices among food producers.

4.  **Deficiency diseases** are caused by the prolonged lack of specific essential nutrients in the diet. They are often reversible with proper nutritional intervention. Examples include:
    *   **Kwashiorkor:** Caused by protein deficiency.
    *   **Anaemia:** Caused by iron deficiency.
    *   **Rickets:** Caused by Vitamin D deficiency.
    **Lifestyle diseases**, on the other hand, are primarily linked to a person's daily habits, diet, and physical activity levels. They often develop over time and are typically non-communicable. Examples include:
    *   **Obesity:** Caused by excessive calorie intake and lack of exercise.
    *   **Diabetes:** Often linked to high sugar/calorie diets and sedentary lifestyle.
    *   **Hypertension:** Can be caused by high sodium intake, stress, and lack of physical activity.

5.  **Sprouted foods** (e.g., sprouted moong) and **fermented foods** (e.g., yogurt, idli) are important in our diet due to their enhanced nutritional value and health benefits. Sprouting increases the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals, makes proteins more digestible, and reduces anti-nutrients. Fermentation introduces beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) that improve gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and boost the immune system. Both processes break down complex compounds, making the food easier to digest and more nutritious.

6.  **Anaemia** is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. It is most commonly caused by **iron deficiency**, as iron is crucial for hemoglobin production. Symptoms include persistent weakness, fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Prevention involves consuming iron-rich foods (e.g., leafy greens, meat, fortified cereals) and Vitamin C to aid iron absorption. Groups most at risk include pregnant women, young children, and individuals with chronic blood loss.

7.  **Lifestyle diseases** are non-communicable diseases whose prevalence is largely influenced by daily habits, diet, and physical activity. **Diabetes** (specifically Type 2) is a prime example. It is characterized by the body's inability to effectively regulate blood sugar, often due to insulin resistance. Its causes are strongly linked to a sedentary lifestyle, high intake of sugary and processed foods, and obesity. Symptoms include frequent urination, increased thirst, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. Prevention methods involve maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical activity, and a balanced diet low in refined sugars and unhealthy fats.

8.  Regular consumption of **junk food** has numerous harmful effects on health. Being high in calories, unhealthy fats, sugar, and salt, it primarily contributes to **weight gain and obesity**. Its lack of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber leads to **nutrient deficiencies**. This poor nutritional profile significantly increases the risk of developing **lifestyle diseases** such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Furthermore, the high sugar content promotes **dental problems** like tooth decay, and its low fiber content can cause **digestive issues** like constipation.

9.  **Rickets** is a bone disease that affects children, characterized by soft and weak bones. It is primarily caused by a severe **deficiency of Vitamin D**, which is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, crucial minerals for bone development. Symptoms include bowed legs, delayed growth, bone pain, and muscle weakness. Children are more susceptible because their bones are still growing rapidly, and inadequate Vitamin D during this critical period directly impairs proper bone mineralization, leading to deformities. Prevention involves adequate sunlight exposure and Vitamin D-rich foods or supplements.

10. **Hypertension**, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. It is often called a **'silent killer'** because it typically has no obvious symptoms in its early stages, allowing it to cause significant damage to the body without the individual being aware. Its long-term effects are severe and include increased risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, heart failure, and vision loss. Regular monitoring and lifestyle changes are crucial for management and prevention of these serious complications.

11. **Vitamins** are organic compounds required in small quantities for various metabolic processes, growth, and overall health maintenance. They play a crucial role in boosting immunity, aiding energy production, and protecting cells.
    *   **Night Blindness:** Caused by **Vitamin A deficiency**. Symptoms include difficulty seeing in dim light.
    *   **Scurvy:** Caused by **Vitamin C deficiency**. Symptoms include bleeding gums, fatigue, and poor wound healing.
    *   **Rickets:** Caused by **Vitamin D deficiency**. Symptoms include soft and weak bones, leading to deformities like bowed legs.

12. **Water** is indispensable for almost all bodily functions. It acts as a solvent, transporting nutrients to cells and waste products away from them. It regulates body temperature through sweating, lubricates joints, and protects organs and tissues. When the body doesn't get enough water, it leads to **dehydration**. Symptoms of dehydration include thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, reduced urination, and dizziness. Severe dehydration can impair kidney function, lead to heatstroke, and in extreme cases, be life-threatening as vital bodily processes cannot function correctly.

13. **Probiotics** are live microorganisms, primarily beneficial bacteria and yeasts, that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. They are crucial for **digestive health** by maintaining a balanced gut microbiome, aiding in nutrient absorption, and preventing the growth of harmful bacteria. They also significantly **boost overall immunity** by strengthening the gut barrier and modulating immune responses. Examples of probiotic foods include **yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi**.

14. **Obesity** is a complex lifestyle disease characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat that poses a risk to health. Its primary causes include a chronic **imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure**, often due to consuming high-calorie, processed foods and leading a sedentary lifestyle. Genetic predispositions and environmental factors also play a role. Health risks associated with obesity are extensive, including increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, certain cancers, and joint problems. Prevention strategies focus on adopting a **balanced diet** rich in whole foods, engaging in **regular physical activity**, and practicing portion control.

15. **Minerals** are inorganic nutrients essential for various bodily functions, including building strong bones and teeth, maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and blood formation.
    *   **Iron deficiency** leads to **anaemia**, characterized by weakness, fatigue, and pale skin due to insufficient hemoglobin production. Iron is vital for oxygen transport in the blood.
    *   **Iodine deficiency** causes **goitre**, a swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck. Iodine is crucial for the thyroid gland to produce hormones that regulate metabolism and growth. Both deficiencies can have significant impacts on overall health and development.
