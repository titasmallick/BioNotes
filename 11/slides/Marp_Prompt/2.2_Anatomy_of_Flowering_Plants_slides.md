# Anatomy of Flowering Plants

## Chapter 2.2

---

## 1. Plant Tissues

*   Cohesive group of cells, structurally and functionally related.
*   Study of tissues: Histology.

---

### Meristematic Tissues: The Architects of Growth

*   Undifferentiated, actively dividing cells.
*   Responsible for continuous plant growth.

---

#### Characteristics of Meristematic Tissue

*   Small, isodiametric, thin-walled cells.
*   Dense cytoplasm, prominent nucleus.
*   Small or absent vacuoles.
*   Absent intercellular spaces.
*   High rate of mitotic division.

---

#### Classification of Meristems (by Origin)

*   **Promeristem:** Earliest, youngest (in embryo).
*   **Primary Meristem:** From promeristem, primary growth (e.g., apical meristem).
*   **Secondary Meristem:** From permanent tissues, secondary growth (e.g., vascular cambium, cork cambium).

---

#### Classification of Meristems (by Location)

*   **Apical Meristems:** Tips of roots/shoots, increase length (primary growth).
*   **Intercalary Meristems:** Between mature tissues, common in grasses, regenerate parts.
*   **Lateral Meristems:** Mature regions, parallel to axis, increase girth/thickness (secondary growth).
    *   Examples: Vascular cambium, cork cambium.

---

### Permanent Tissues: The Specialized Workforce

*   Derived from meristematic tissues, differentiated, lose ability to divide.
*   Specialized for specific functions.

---

#### Simple Tissues (Single cell type)

*   **Parenchyma:**
    *   **Structure:** Isodiametric, thin-walled, large vacuoles, intercellular spaces.
    *   **Function:** Photosynthesis (chlorenchyma), storage (food, water), secretion.
    *   **Location:** Cortex, pith, mesophyll, vascular tissues.
*   **Collenchyma:**
    *   **Structure:** Elongated cells, unevenly thickened primary walls (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin).
    *   **Function:** Mechanical support and flexibility to growing parts (young stems, petioles).
    *   **Location:** Hypodermis of dicot stems, petioles.
*   **Sclerenchyma:**
    *   **Structure:** Long, narrow cells, thick, lignified secondary walls, often dead at maturity.
    *   **Function:** Mechanical support and protection.
    *   **Types:** Fibres (long, tapering), Sclereids (short, irregular, stone cells).

---

#### Complex Tissues (Multiple cell types)

*   **Xylem:** Primary water-conducting tissue.
    *   **Function:** Transport water/minerals from roots, mechanical support.
    *   **Components:** Tracheids, Vessels, Xylem Fibres, Xylem Parenchyma.
*   **Phloem:** Primary food-conducting tissue.
    *   **Function:** Transport sugars from leaves.
    *   **Components:** Sieve Tube Elements, Companion Cells, Phloem Parenchyma, Phloem Fibres.

---

## 2. The Tissue System: A Coordinated Framework

### Epidermal Tissue System: The Protective Outer Layer

*   **Function:** Outermost covering, protection (mechanical injury, water loss, pathogens).
*   **Components:**
    *   **Epidermal Cells:** Continuous single layer.
    *   **Stomata:** Pores for gas exchange/transpiration, surrounded by guard cells.
    *   **Epidermal Appendages:** Trichomes (hairs), Root Hairs (unicellular extensions for absorption).

---

### Ground Tissue System: The Bulk of the Plant Body

*   **Function:** Photosynthesis, storage, support.
*   **Components:** Parenchyma, Collenchyma, Sclerenchyma.

---

### Vascular Tissue System: The Conductive Network

*   **Function:** Transport water, minerals, food (xylem and phloem).
*   **Vascular Bundles:** Xylem and phloem organized into bundles.
    *   **Radial:** Xylem and phloem on different radii (roots).
    *   **Conjoint:** Xylem and phloem on same radius (stems, leaves).
        *   **Collateral:** Phloem outer to xylem.
        *   **Bicollateral:** Phloem on both outer and inner sides of xylem.

---

## 3. Anatomy of Dicotyledonous and Monocotyledonous Plants

### Dicot Root: A Detailed Cross-Section

*   **Epiblema (Epidermis):** Outermost, single layer, root hairs for absorption.
*   **Cortex:** Wide zone of parenchyma, storage, water conduction.
*   **Endodermis:** Innermost cortex layer, barrel-shaped cells, Casparian strips (suberin) prevent apoplastic water movement.
*   **Stele:** Central core (internal to endodermis).
    *   **Pericycle:** Single layer, origin of lateral roots/vascular cambium.
    *   **Vascular Bundles:** Radial arrangement, alternating xylem/phloem, 2-6 xylem bundles (diarch to hexarch), exarch protoxylem.
    *   **Pith:** Absent or very small.

---

### Monocot Root: A Comparative Analysis

*   Similar to dicot root, but:
    *   **Vascular Bundles:** More than six xylem bundles (polyarch).
    *   **Pith:** Large, well-developed.
    *   **Secondary Growth:** Absent (lacks vascular cambium).

---

### Dicot Stem: A Comprehensive Overview

*   **Epidermis:** Outermost, single layer, covered by waxy cuticle.
*   **Cortex:** Below epidermis, three zones:
    *   **Hypodermis:** Collenchymatous, mechanical support.
    *   **General Cortex:** Parenchymatous, storage.
    *   **Endodermis:** Innermost cortex layer, not well-defined.
*   **Stele:** Central part (pericycle, vascular bundles, pith).
    *   **Pericycle:** Sclerenchymatous patches above phloem.
    *   **Vascular Bundles:** Arranged in a ring, conjoint, collateral, open (with cambium).
    *   **Pith:** Large, central parenchyma, storage.

---

### Monocot Stem: A Distinctive Arrangement

*   **Epidermis:** Outermost, single layer, cuticle.
*   **Hypodermis:** Thick, sclerenchymatous, mechanical support.
*   **Ground Tissue:** Mass of parenchyma, vascular bundles scattered within.
*   **Vascular Bundles:** Numerous, scattered, conjoint, collateral, closed (lacking cambium). Smaller at periphery, larger at center.
*   **Pith:** Ground tissue not differentiated into cortex and pith.

---

### Dicot Leaf (Dorsiventral): A Study in Asymmetry

*   **Epidermis:** Upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial), cutinized. Lower usually has more stomata.
*   **Mesophyll:** Ground tissue between epidermises, differentiated:
    *   **Palisade Parenchyma:** Elongated, compactly arranged, rich in chloroplasts (below upper epidermis).
    *   **Spongy Parenchyma:** Irregularly shaped, loosely arranged, numerous air spaces (below palisade).
*   **Vascular Bundles:** In veins/midrib, conjoint, collateral, closed, surrounded by bundle sheath.

---

### Monocot Leaf (Isobilateral): A Study in Symmetry

*   **Epidermis:** Stomata present on both upper and lower epidermis.
*   **Mesophyll:** Not differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma.
*   **Bulliform Cells:** Large, empty, colorless cells in upper epidermis of some grasses; help in leaf rolling/unrolling.
*   **Vascular Bundles:** Similar to dicot leaf, but more numerous and closely arranged.
