# Cell - The Unit of Life

## Chapter 3.1

---

## 1. Historical Aspects & Cell Theory

*   **Robert Hooke (1665):** First observed and coined "cell" (cork).
*   **Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1674):** First observed live cells.
*   **Robert Brown (1831):** Discovered the nucleus.
*   **Schleiden (1838) & Schwann (1839):** Proposed Cell Theory.
*   **Rudolf Virchow (1855):** "Omnis cellula-e cellula" (all cells arise from pre-existing cells).

---

### Modern Cell Theory Postulates

1.  All living organisms are composed of cells and cell products.
2.  All cells arise from pre-existing cells.
3.  The cell is the structural and functional unit of all living organisms.
4.  Cells contain hereditary information (DNA) passed during division.
5.  All cells are basically the same in chemical composition and metabolic activities.

### Cell Size and Shape

*   **Size:** Varies greatly.
    *   Smallest: Mycoplasma (0.3 µm).
    *   Largest isolated single cell: Ostrich egg.
    *   Human RBCs: ~7.0 µm.
*   **Shape:** Varies with function (disc-like, polygonal, irregular, etc.).

## 2. General Structure of a Eukaryotic Cell

*   Possess a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
*   Includes protists, fungi, plants, animals.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nucleus** | Absent (nucleoid) | Present (true nucleus) |

| **DNA** | Circular, naked | Linear, with histones |
| **Cell Division** | Binary fission | Mitosis and meiosis |

## 3. Cell Envelope

*   Consists of cell wall and cell membrane.

---

### Cell Wall

*   Rigid, non-living outer covering (plants, fungi, some protists).
*   **Functions:** Shape, protection, cell-to-cell interaction, barrier.
*   **Ultrastructure:** Primary Wall, Secondary Wall, Middle Lamella (calcium pectate, glues cells).
*   **Plasmodesmata:** Cytoplasmic bridges connecting plant cells.

---

### Plasma Membrane (Cell Membrane)

*   **Fluid Mosaic Model (Singer & Nicolson, 1972):** Quasi-fluid lipid bilayer with embedded proteins.
    *   **Lipids:** Phosphoglycerides, polar head (hydrophilic), nonpolar tail (hydrophobic).
    *   **Proteins:** Integral (buried), Peripheral (surface).
*   **Functions:** Selective permeability, transport.

---

### Plasma Membrane Transport

*   **Passive Transport (No energy):** Along concentration gradient.
    *   **Simple Diffusion:** Neutral solutes.
    *   **Osmosis:** Water movement.
    *   **Facilitated Diffusion:** With carrier proteins.
        *   Uniport (one molecule), Symport (two same direction), Antiport (two opposite direction).
*   **Active Transport (Requires ATP):** Against concentration gradient (e.g., Na+/K+ pump).

## 4. Cell Organelles

### Endomembrane System

*   Coordinated organelles: ER, Golgi, Lysosomes, Vacuoles.

---

#### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

*   Network of tiny tubular structures.
*   **Rough ER (RER):** With ribosomes, protein synthesis and secretion.
*   **Smooth ER (SER):** No ribosomes, lipid and steroidal hormone synthesis.

---

#### Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Complex)

*   Flattened, disc-shaped sacs (cisternae).
*   **Functions:** Processing, packaging, transport of materials from ER. Glycoprotein/glycolipid formation. Cell wall material synthesis (plants).

---

#### Lysosomes

*   Membrane-bound vesicles with hydrolytic enzymes.
*   Digestion of macromolecules.
*   "Suicidal bags" (digest cell's own components).

---

#### Vacuoles

*   Membrane-bound space (tonoplast).
*   Up to 90% cell volume in plants.
*   Stores water, sap, excretory products.

---

### Mitochondria

*   Double membrane-bound, "powerhouses" of the cell.
*   **Structure:** Outer membrane (smooth), Inner membrane (folded into cristae, increases surface area). Matrix (inner compartment, Krebs cycle enzymes, circular DNA, 70S ribosomes).
*   **Function:** Aerobic respiration, ATP synthesis.

---

### Plastids

*   Found in plant cells and euglenoids.
*   **Chloroplasts:** Chlorophyll, carotenoids. Site of photosynthesis. Thylakoids (grana) in stroma.
*   **Chromoplasts:** Carotenoid pigments (yellow, orange, red color to flowers/fruits).
*   **Leucoplasts:** Colorless, store nutrients.
    *   Amyloplasts (starch), Elaioplasts (oils/fats), Aleuroplasts (proteins).
