# Neural Control and Coordination

## Chapter 5.5

---

## 1. Neuron and Nerves

*   **Neuron (Nerve Cell):** Structural and functional unit of nervous system.
    *   **Cell Body (Soma/Cyton):** Contains cytoplasm, Nisslâ€™s granules.
    *   **Dendrites:** Short, branched, transmit impulses *towards* cell body.
    *   **Axon:** Long fibre, transmits impulses *away* from cell body. Terminates in synaptic knob with neurotransmitters.
*   **Nerves:** Bundles of axons in PNS.

---

### Types of Neurons (by Axon/Dendrite Number)

*   **Unipolar:** One axon only (embryonic).
*   **Bipolar:** One axon, one dendrite (retina, olfactory epithelium).
*   **Multipolar:** One axon, two+ dendrites (cerebral cortex).
*   **Pseudounipolar:** Single process divides into axon and dendrite (dorsal root ganglia).

---

### Types of Axons

*   **Myelinated Nerve Fibre:** Axon enveloped by Schwann cells forming myelin sheath. Gaps are Nodes of Ranvier. (Spinal/cranial nerves).
*   **Non-myelinated Nerve Fibre:** Axon enclosed by Schwann cell, no myelin sheath. (Autonomous/somatic neural systems).

---

## 2. Generation and Conduction of Nerve Impulse

*   Nerve impulse: Wave of electrochemical change along neuron.

---

### a) Resting Potential (Polarized State)

*   Resting neuron: Axonal membrane more permeable to K+, less to Na+.
*   High K+, negative proteins inside; high Na+ outside.
*   Maintained by **sodium-potassium pump** (3 Na+ out, 2 K+ in).
*   Outer surface positive, inner negative. Electrical potential difference = **resting potential**. Membrane is **polarized**.

---

### b) Action Potential (Depolarized State)

*   Stimulus applied: Membrane becomes permeable to Na+.
*   Rapid Na+ influx, polarity reverses (outer negative, inner positive).
*   This reversal is **depolarization**.
*   Electrical potential difference = **action potential** (nerve impulse).

---

### c) Repolarization

*   At action potential peak: Na+ permeability decreases, K+ permeability increases.
*   K+ diffuses outwards, membrane potential returns to resting.

---

### d) Conduction of Nerve Impulse

*   Action potential at one site generates current flow, depolarizing adjacent site.
*   Sequence repeats along axon.
*   **Saltatory Conduction:** In myelinated fibres, impulse jumps from node to node (much faster).

---

## 3. Synaptic Transmission

*   Nerve impulse transmitted between neurons at **synapses**.
*   **Synapse:** Junction of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuron membranes, with or without synaptic cleft.

---

### Types of Synapses

*   **Electrical Synapse:** Membranes very close, direct current flow. Faster.
*   **Chemical Synapse:** Membranes separated by **synaptic cleft**. **Neurotransmitters** involved.

---

### Mechanism of Chemical Synaptic Transmission

1.  Action potential arrives at axon terminal (synaptic knob).
2.  Synaptic vesicles fuse with membrane, release neurotransmitters into cleft.
3.  Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on post-synaptic membrane.
4.  Ion channels open, generating new potential (excitatory or inhibitory) in post-synaptic neuron.
*   **Neurotransmitters:** Acetylcholine, Dopamine, Serotonin, GABA, etc.

---

## 4. Human Nervous System

### a) Central Nervous System (CNS)

*   Includes brain and spinal cord.
*   Site of information processing and control.

---

#### i) Brain

*   **Forebrain (Prosencephalon):**
    *   **Cerebrum:** Two cerebral hemispheres connected by **corpus callosum**. Cerebral cortex (grey matter) has motor, sensory, and **association areas** (memory, communication). Inner part is white matter.
    *   **Thalamus:** Coordinating center for sensory/motor signaling.
    *   **Hypothalamus:** Controls body temperature, eating/drinking urges, secretes hypothalamic hormones.

---

*   **Midbrain (Mesencephalon):** Between forebrain and pons. Cerebral aqueduct passes through. Dorsal part has **corpora quadrigemina**.
*   **Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon):**
    *   **Pons:** Fibre tracts interconnecting brain regions.
    *   **Cerebellum:** Convoluted surface, regulates balance, coordinates voluntary movements.
    *   **Medulla Oblongata:** Connected to spinal cord. Controls respiration, cardiovascular reflexes, gastric secretions.

---

#### ii) Spinal Cord

*   Long, thin, tubular structure from medulla oblongata to lumbar region.
*   Covered by meninges. Grey matter in center (H-shaped), white matter outside.
*   **Functions:**
    1.  Conducts sensory/motor impulses to/from brain.
    2.  Center for reflex actions.

---

### b) Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

*   All nerves associated with CNS.
*   **Somatic Nervous System:** Relays impulses from CNS to skeletal muscles.
*   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Transmits impulses from CNS to involuntary organs/smooth muscles.
    *   **Sympathetic Nervous System.**
    *   **Parasympathetic Nervous System.**

---

### c) Visceral Nervous System

*   Part of PNS, part of ANS.
*   Complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, plexuses.
*   Transmits impulses between CNS and viscera (internal organs).
