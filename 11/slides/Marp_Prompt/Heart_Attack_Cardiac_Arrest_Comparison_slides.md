# Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction) vs. Cardiac Arrest

## A Detailed Comparison

---

## I. Overview Table

| Feature           | Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)                               | Cardiac Arrest                                                              |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Death of heart muscle due to prolonged lack of blood supply.       | Abrupt loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness due to electrical problem. |
| **Primary Problem** | **Circulatory (Plumbing)**: Blockage in a coronary artery.         | **Electrical (Wiring)**: Malfunction in heart's electrical system.          |
| **Cause**         | Blood clot in coronary artery (atherosclerosis).                   | Life-threatening arrhythmia (e.g., ventricular fibrillation).               |
| **Symptoms**      | Chest pain, shortness of breath, radiating pain, nausea. Patient usually conscious. | Sudden collapse, no breathing, no pulse, loss of consciousness.             |
| **Consciousness** | **Conscious** (may feel faint).                                    | **Unconscious** immediately.                                                |
| **Breathing**     | May have shortness of breath, but **still breathing**.             | **Not breathing** (or only gasping).                                        |
| **Pulse**         | **Present** (may be weak/irregular).                               | **Absent**.                                                                 |
| **ECG Findings**  | ST-segment elevation/depression, T-wave inversion, Q waves.        | VF, pVT, Asystole, PEA.                                                     |
| **Immediate Treatment** | Restore blood flow (angioplasty, thrombolytics), oxygen, pain relief. | **CPR** and **Defibrillation** (if shockable rhythm).                       |
| **Prognosis**     | Depends on damage/treatment. Can lead to heart failure/arrhythmias. | Very poor without immediate CPR/defibrillation.                             |
| **Relationship**  | **Can lead to** cardiac arrest.                                    | **Consequence** of underlying problem (may or may not be MI).               |

## II. Detailed Explanation: Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)

### A. Definition and Mechanism

*   Occurs when blood flow to heart muscle is severely reduced or blocked.
*   Usually due to plaque buildup (atherosclerosis) and blood clot in coronary artery.
*   Affected heart muscle tissue begins to die (infarct).

---

### B. Causes

*   **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):** Narrowing/hardening of arteries.
*   **Blood Clot:** Forms on ruptured plaque.
*   **Coronary Artery Spasm:** Less common, artery tightens.
*   **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD):** Tear in artery wall.

---

### C. Symptoms

*   **Chest Pain:** Pressure, tightness, squeezing; may radiate to arm, jaw, back.
*   Shortness of breath.
*   Cold sweat, nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness/dizziness, unusual fatigue.
*   **Patient remains conscious, has a pulse, and is breathing.**

---

### D. ECG Findings

*   **STEMI:** ST-segment elevation (complete blockage).
*   **NSTEMI:** ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion (partial/temporary blockage).
*   **Pathological Q Waves:** Indicate dead heart muscle.

---

### E. Treatment

*   **Immediate:** Oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin/antiplatelets, pain relief.
*   **Reperfusion Therapy:**
    *   **PCI (Angioplasty with Stent):** Catheter to open artery.
    *   **Thrombolytic (Clot-Busting) Drugs:** Dissolve clot.

---

### F. Prognosis

*   Depends on extent of damage and speed of treatment.
*   Complications: Heart failure, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock.

---

## III. Detailed Explanation: Cardiac Arrest

### A. Definition and Mechanism

*   Abrupt and complete cessation of heart's pumping function.
*   Primarily an **electrical problem** (chaotic or absent electrical activity).
*   Prevents blood pumping to brain/organ.

---

### B. Causes

*   **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF):** Most common, ventricles quiver.
*   **Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT):** Rapid, ineffective electrical activity.
*   **Asystole:** Complete absence of electrical activity ("flat line").
*   **Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA):** Organized electrical activity, but no mechanical contraction.
*   **Severe Heart Attack:** Can disrupt electrical system.
*   Other: Electrocution, drowning, drug overdose, trauma, choking, electrolyte imbalances, congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy.

---

### C. Symptoms

*   **Sudden Collapse:** Without warning.
*   **Loss of Consciousness:** Immediate.
*   **No Breathing:** Or only gasping/agonal breaths.
*   **No Pulse:** No detectable pulse.
*   **Patient is unconscious, not breathing, and has no pulse.**

---

### D. ECG Findings

*   Life-threatening arrhythmia:
    *   **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF):** Chaotic, irregular.
    *   **Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT):** Rapid, wide QRS, no pulse.
    *   **Asystole:** Flat line.
    *   **Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA):** Organized electrical activity, no pulse.

---

### E. Treatment

*   **Immediate:**
    *   **Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):** Chest compressions, rescue breaths.
    *   **Defibrillation:** Electrical shock (for VF or pVT).
*   **Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS):** By medical professionals (airway, IV meds, reversible causes).

---

### F. Prognosis

*   Very low survival, especially outside hospital.
*   Depends heavily on speed of CPR and defibrillation.
*   Every minute without intervention reduces survival and increases neurological damage.

---

## IV. The Critical Relationship

*   A heart attack **can cause** cardiac arrest (if damage disrupts electrical system).
*   Not all heart attacks lead to cardiac arrest.
*   Not all cardiac arrests are caused by heart attacks.
*   Understanding differences is vital for recognizing emergency and initiating correct interventions.
