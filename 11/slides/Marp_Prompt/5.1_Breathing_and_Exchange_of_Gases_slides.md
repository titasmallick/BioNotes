# Breathing and Exchange of Gases

## Chapter 5.1

---

## 1. Respiratory Organs in Animals

*   **Sponges, Coelenterates, Flatworms:** Entire body surface (simple diffusion).
*   **Earthworms:** Moist cuticle (cutaneous respiration).
*   **Insects:** Tracheal system (direct to cells).
*   **Aquatic Arthropods & Molluscs:** Gills (branchial respiration).
*   **Terrestrial Vertebrates:** Lungs (pulmonary respiration).
*   **Amphibians (Frogs):** Moist skin and lungs.

---

## 2. Respiratory System in Humans

*   **Pathway of Air:** Nostrils → Nasal Passage → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea → Bronchi → Bronchioles → Alveoli.
*   **Organs:**
    *   **Nose:** Filters, warms, moistens air.
    *   **Pharynx:** Common passage.
    *   **Larynx (Sound Box):** Cartilaginous, sound production. Epiglottis prevents food entry.
    *   **Trachea (Windpipe):** C-shaped cartilaginous rings.
    *   **Bronchi, Bronchioles, Alveoli:** Branching tubes ending in vascularized, balloon-like alveoli.
    *   **Lungs:** Spongy, air-filled, covered by double-layered pleura.
    *   **Diaphragm:** Dome-shaped muscle at base of lungs.

---

## 3. Mechanism of Breathing

### Inspiration (Inhalation)

*   Active process.
*   Diaphragm contracts and flattens.
*   External intercostal muscles contract, lifting ribs/sternum.
*   Increases thoracic cavity volume, then lung volume.
*   Intra-pulmonary pressure decreases < atmospheric pressure.
*   Air rushes into lungs.

---

### Expiration (Exhalation)

*   Passive process.
*   Diaphragm relaxes, returns to dome shape.
*   External intercostal muscles relax, ribs/sternum return.
*   Decreases thoracic cavity volume, then lung volume.
*   Intra-pulmonary pressure increases > atmospheric pressure.
*   Air expelled from lungs.

---

## 4. Exchange of Gases

*   Passive diffusion based on pressure/concentration gradients.

---

### Alveolar Gas Exchange

*   **O₂:** High pO₂ in alveoli (104 mmHg) → Low pO₂ in deoxygenated blood (40 mmHg). O₂ diffuses into blood.
*   **CO₂:** High pCO₂ in deoxygenated blood (45 mmHg) → Low pCO₂ in alveoli (40 mmHg). CO₂ diffuses into alveoli.

---

### Tissue Gas Exchange

*   **O₂:** High pO₂ in oxygenated blood (95 mmHg) → Low pO₂ in tissues (40 mmHg). O₂ diffuses into tissues.
*   **CO₂:** High pCO₂ in tissues (45 mmHg) → Low pCO₂ in oxygenated blood (40 mmHg). CO₂ diffuses into blood.

---

## 5. Transport of Gases

### Transport of Oxygen

*   **Dissolved in Plasma:** ~3%.
*   **As Oxyhaemoglobin:** ~97% by RBCs. O₂ binds reversibly with haemoglobin (Hb).
    *   `Hb + 4O₂ ↔ Hb(O₂)₄`

---

### Oxyhaemoglobin Dissociation Curve

*   Sigmoid (S-shaped) curve.
*   **Shift to the Right (Lower Hb affinity for O₂):** O₂ released to tissues.
    *   High pCO₂, High H⁺ (low pH - **Bohr Effect**), High temperature.
*   **Shift to the Left (Higher Hb affinity for O₂):**
    *   Low pCO₂, Low H⁺ (high pH), Low temperature.

---

### Transport of Carbon Dioxide

*   **Dissolved in Plasma:** ~7%.
*   **As Carbamino-haemoglobin:** ~20-25% by Hb (CO₂ binds to amino groups).
*   **As Bicarbonate Ions (HCO₃⁻):** ~70%.
    *   CO₂ + H₂O ↔ H₂CO₃ (carbonic anhydrase).
    *   H₂CO₃ ↔ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻.

---

### Chloride Shift (Hamburger's Phenomenon)

*   HCO₃⁻ moves out of RBCs into plasma.
*   Cl⁻ from plasma diffuses into RBCs to maintain electrochemical neutrality.

---

## 6. Regulation of Breathing

*   **Respiratory Rhythm Centre:** Medulla oblongata (generates rhythm).
*   **Pneumotaxic Centre:** Pons (moderates rhythm, reduces inspiration duration).
*   **Chemosensitive Area:** Adjacent to rhythm centre, sensitive to CO₂ and H⁺ (signals adjustments).
*   **Peripheral Chemoreceptors:** Aortic arch, carotid artery (detect CO₂/H⁺ changes, signal rhythm centre).

---

## 7. Respiratory Volumes and Lung Capacities

*   **Tidal Volume (TV):** Normal inspiration/expiration (500 mL).
*   **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):** Additional air inspired forcibly (2500-3000 mL).
*   **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):** Additional air expired forcibly (1000-1100 mL).
*   **Residual Volume (RV):** Air remaining after forced expiration (1100-1200 mL).

---

### Lung Capacities (Combinations of Volumes)

*   **Inspiratory Capacity (IC):** TV + IRV.
*   **Expiratory Capacity (EC):** TV + ERV.
*   **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):** ERV + RV.
*   **Vital Capacity (VC):** ERV + TV + IRV.
*   **Total Lung Capacity (TLC):** RV + ERV + TV + IRV (or VC + RV).

---

## 8. Disorders of the Respiratory System

*   **Asthma:** Difficulty breathing, wheezing due to inflammation of bronchi/bronchioles (allergens).
*   **Emphysema:** Alveolar walls damaged, decreased respiratory surface area (cigarette smoking).
*   **Occupational Respiratory Disorders:** Long-term exposure to dust (e.g., grinding, stone-breaking).
    *   Inflammation, fibrosis, lung damage.
    *   **Silicosis:** From silica dust.
    *   **Asbestosis:** From asbestos dust.
