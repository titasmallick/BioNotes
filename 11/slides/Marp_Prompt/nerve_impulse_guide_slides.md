# Nerve Impulse Transmission

## Comprehensive Study Guide

---

## 1. Overview of Neural Communication

*   Fundamental mechanism for information transfer in nervous system.
*   Involves electrical and chemical signals.
*   Allows rapid communication over long distances.

---

## 2. Resting Membrane Potential

### Establishment and Maintenance

*   **Resting potential:** -70 mV (inside negative relative to outside).
*   Maintained by **sodium-potassium pump (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase)**.
    *   Pumps 3 Na⁺ out for 2 K⁺ in per ATP.
*   Creates net negative charge inside.

---

### Ion Distribution at Rest

*   **Intracellular:** High K⁺, Low Na⁺.
*   **Extracellular:** High Na⁺, Low K⁺.
*   **Membrane permeability:** K⁺ > Cl⁻ >> Na⁺.

---

## 3. Action Potential Generation

### Threshold Potential

*   **Threshold value:** ~-55 mV.
*   Critical membrane potential to trigger action potential.
*   Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels begin rapid opening.

---

### All-or-Nothing Principle

*   Action potentials either occur completely or not at all.
*   No gradation in amplitude once threshold is reached.
*   Amplitude remains constant (~100 mV swing).
*   Duration: ~1-2 milliseconds.

---

## 4. Phases of Action Potential

### Phase 1: Depolarization (-70 mV to +30 mV)

*   **Trigger:** Stimulus reaches threshold (-55 mV).
*   **Mechanism:** Rapid opening of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels.
*   **Na⁺ influx:** Massive inward current of sodium ions.
*   **Peak potential:** +30 mV to +40 mV.
*   **Time:** ~0.5-1.0 milliseconds.

---

### Phase 2: Repolarization (+30 mV to -70 mV)

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels inactivate.
    *   Voltage-gated K⁺ channels open.
*   **K⁺ efflux:** Potassium ions flow out of the cell.
*   **Duration:** ~1-2 milliseconds.
*   **Result:** Membrane potential returns toward resting level.

---

### Phase 3: Hyperpolarization (-70 mV to -80 mV)

*   **Cause:** Delayed closure of voltage-gated K⁺ channels.
*   **Potential:** Can reach -80 to -90 mV.
*   **Duration:** 2-4 milliseconds.
*   **Recovery:** Na⁺/K⁺ pump restores resting potential.

---

## 5. Refractory Periods

### Absolute Refractory Period

*   **Duration:** 1-2 milliseconds.
*   **Mechanism:** Na⁺ channels are inactivated.
*   **Characteristic:** No stimulus can trigger another action potential.
*   **Significance:** Ensures unidirectional propagation.

---

### Relative Refractory Period

*   **Duration:** 2-4 milliseconds (following absolute period).
*   **Mechanism:** Some Na⁺ channels recovered, K⁺ channels still open.
*   **Characteristic:** Stronger-than-normal stimulus required.
*   **Threshold:** Elevated during this period.

---

## 6. Roles of Sodium (Na⁺) and Potassium (K⁺)

### Sodium (Na⁺)

*   **Primary role:** Depolarization phase.
*   **Channel types:** Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels, leak channels.
*   **Activation:** Rapid opening at threshold.
*   **Inactivation:** Automatic closure during peak potential.
*   **Driving force:** Large electrochemical gradient favors influx.

---

### Potassium (K⁺)

*   **Primary roles:** Maintaining resting potential, repolarization phase.
*   **Channel types:** Voltage-gated K⁺ channels, leak channels.
*   **Characteristics:** Slower kinetics than Na⁺ channels.
*   **Driving force:** Electrochemical gradient favors efflux during action potential.

---

## 7. Saltatory Conduction

### Myelinated Axons

*   **Myelin sheath:** Insulating layers of lipid-rich membrane.
    *   Formed by Oligodendrocytes (CNS) or Schwann cells (PNS).
*   **Nodes of Ranvier:** Unmyelinated gaps (~1 μm wide, 1-2 mm apart).

---

### Mechanism of Saltatory Conduction

*   Current flow occurs only at nodes of Ranvier.
*   Action potential appears to "jump" from node to node.
*   **Speed advantage:** Myelinated axons (1-120 m/s) vs. Unmyelinated (0.5-2 m/s).
*   **Energy efficiency:** Reduced metabolic cost.

---

### Factors Affecting Conduction Velocity

*   **Axon diameter:** Larger diameter = faster.
*   **Myelination:** Presence increases speed dramatically.
*   **Temperature:** Higher temperature = faster.
*   **Ion channel density:** Higher density at nodes = faster.

---

## 8. Synaptic Transmission

### Synaptic Structure

*   **Presynaptic terminal:** Contains synaptic vesicles and Ca²⁺ channels.
*   **Synaptic cleft:** ~20-50 nm gap between neurons.
*   **Postsynaptic membrane:** Contains neurotransmitter receptors.

---

### Chemical Synaptic Transmission Process

1.  **Action Potential Arrival:** Depolarization reaches presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open.
2.  **Calcium Influx:** Ca²⁺ concentration increases, triggers vesicle fusion.
3.  **Vesicle Fusion and Exocytosis:** SNARE proteins mediate fusion, neurotransmitters released into cleft.
4.  **Neurotransmitter Diffusion:** Molecules cross synaptic cleft (~0.1-0.5 ms).
5.  **Receptor Binding:** Neurotransmitter binds to postsynaptic receptors, opening ion channels.

---

### Synaptic Delay

*   **Total delay:** 0.5-1.0 milliseconds.
*   **Components:** Ca²⁺ influx/binding, vesicle fusion, neurotransmitter diffusion, receptor activation.

---

## 9. Neurotransmitter Receptors

### Ionotropic Receptors (Ligand-gated ion channels)

*   **Structure:** Receptor and ion channel are same protein.
*   **Response time:** 1-5 milliseconds.
*   **Duration:** 10-100 milliseconds.
*   **Examples:** Nicotinic acetylcholine, GABA-A, NMDA/AMPA glutamate receptors.

---

### Metabotropic Receptors (G-protein coupled)

*   **Structure:** Receptor activates intracellular signaling cascades.
*   **Response time:** 50-500 milliseconds.
*   **Duration:** Seconds to minutes.
*   **Examples:** Muscarinic acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin receptors.

---

## 10. Postsynaptic Potentials

### Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs)

*   **Mechanism:** Opening of Na⁺/K⁺ channels.
*   **Effect:** Depolarization (typically 1-5 mV).
*   **Neurotransmitters:** Glutamate, acetylcholine (nicotinic).

---

### Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs)

*   **Mechanism:** Opening of Cl⁻ or K⁺ channels.
*   **Effect:** Hyperpolarization or stabilization at rest.
*   **Neurotransmitters:** GABA, glycine.

---

### Summation

*   **Temporal summation:** Multiple signals from same synapse.
*   **Spatial summation:** Signals from multiple synapses.
*   **Integration:** Determines whether threshold is reached.

---

## 11. Neurotransmitter Removal

### Mechanisms

1.  **Enzymatic degradation:** (e.g., Acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine).
2.  **Reuptake:** Transporter proteins remove neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine, serotonin).
3.  **Diffusion:** Neurotransmitter moves away from synaptic cleft (slower).

---

## 12. Factors Affecting Synaptic Transmission

### Presynaptic Factors

*   **Ca²⁺ concentration:** Higher = more transmitter release.
*   **Vesicle availability:** Determines sustained transmission.
*   **Previous activity:** Can cause facilitation or depression.

---

### Postsynaptic Factors

*   **Receptor density:** More receptors = stronger response.
*   **Receptor sensitivity:** Can be modified by drugs or disease.
*   **Membrane potential:** Affects driving force for ions.

---

### Environmental Factors

*   **Temperature:** Affects enzyme activity and diffusion.
*   **pH:** Alters protein conformation and function.
*   **Ion concentrations:** Particularly Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and K⁺.

---

## 13. Clinical Significance

### Neurological Disorders

*   **Multiple Sclerosis:** Demyelination slows conduction.
*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Autoimmune attack on acetylcholine receptors.
*   **Epilepsy:** Abnormal synchronous firing of neurons.

---

### Pharmacological Targets

*   **Local anesthetics:** Block voltage-gated Na⁺ channels.
*   **Anticonvulsants:** Modulate Na⁺ or Ca²⁺ channels.
*   **Antidepressants:** Block neurotransmitter reuptake.
