# Plant Physiology: Detailed Notes

---

## 1. Photoperiodism and Flowering

*   Physiological response of plants to day/night length.
*   Regulates flowering time for reproductive success.

---

### Plant Classification based on Photoperiodism

*   **Short-Day Plants (SDPs):** Flower when day length < critical period (long-night plants).
    *   **Examples:** Chrysanthemums, rice, soybeans.
*   **Long-Day Plants (LDPs):** Flower when day length > critical period (short-night plants).
    *   **Examples:** Spinach, lettuce, potatoes.
*   **Day-Neutral Plants (DNPs):** Flower irrespective of day length.
    *   **Examples:** Tomatoes, cucumbers, corn.

---

### Molecular Mechanism of Flowering Control

*   **Perception:** Occurs in leaves, involves circadian clock and photoreceptors.
*   **Circadian Clock & CONSTANS (CO):** Clock measures day length, controls CO gene expression. CO protein stable in light.
*   **Florigen (FT Protein):** CO activates *FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)* gene. FT protein is mobile flowering signal, travels to meristem.
*   **Activation:** FT forms Florigen Activation Complex (FAC) at meristem, activates floral identity genes (*APETALA1, LEAFY*), leading to flower development.
*   **Other Pathways:** Autonomous, vernalisation, gibberellin pathways also influence flowering.

## 2. Phytochrome and Light Perception

*   Family of photoreceptor proteins.
*   Detects red and far-red light, contributes to temperature sensing.

---

### Types and Forms

*   **Forms:**
    *   **Pr:** Inactive form, absorbs red light.
    *   **Pfr:** Active form, absorbs far-red light.
*   **Types (in *Arabidopsis*):** PhyA, PhyB, PhyC, PhyD, PhyE.
    *   PhyA: Most sensitive to far-red.
    *   PhyB: Primary red-light receptor, involved in shade avoidance.

## 3. Night Break and Day Break

*   **Night Break:** Brief light exposure during dark period.
    *   Inhibits flowering in SDPs.
    *   Promotes flowering in LDPs.
    *   Alters Pfr/Pr ratio.
*   **Day Break (Dawn Signal):** Transition from dark to light.
    *   Resets circadian clock.
    *   Initiates gene expression for photosynthesis/daytime activities.

---

## 4. Seed Dormancy

*   Seed unable to germinate even under favorable conditions.
*   Crucial survival mechanism.

---

### Hormonal Control

*   Balance between **abscisic acid (ABA)** and **gibberellins (GA)**.
*   **ABA:** Induces and maintains dormancy.
*   **GA:** Promote germination.
*   **ABA/GA Ratio:** High ratio promotes dormancy, low ratio promotes germination.

---

## 5. Vernalisation

*   Induction of flowering by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.

---

### Epigenetic Mechanism

*   Involves epigenetic silencing of **FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)** gene (floral repressor).
*   **Silencing FLC:** Cold induces VIN3 protein, interacts with PRC2 to deposit repressive histone marks at FLC locus. COOLAIR non-coding RNA also contributes.
*   **Memory of Winter:** Silenced FLC maintained by VRN1 and VRN2, ensuring flowering after winter. Epigenetic memory reset in next generation.

---

## 6. Plant Hormones (Phytohormones)

*   Chemical messengers regulating plant growth and development.
*   Work in complex interactions.
*   **Auxins:** Cell elongation, apical dominance, root formation, tropic responses.
*   **Gibberellins (GAs):** Stem elongation, seed germination, flowering.
*   **Cytokinins:** Cell division, shoot formation, delay leaf senescence.
*   **Abscisic Acid (ABA):** Growth inhibitor, promotes dormancy, stomatal closure, senescence.
*   **Ethylene:** Gaseous hormone, fruit ripening, leaf abscission, senescence.
*   **Brassinosteroids:** Cell elongation/division, photomorphogenesis, stress responses.
*   **Strigolactones:** Inhibit shoot branching, promote mycorrhizal symbiosis.

## 7. Allied Topics

### Circadian Rhythms in Plants

*   Internal biological clock.
*   Coordinates biological processes with 24-hour day-night cycle.
*   Optimizes photosynthesis, flowering, energy reserves.

---

### Shade Avoidance Syndrome (SAS)

*   Responses to avoid shading by other plants.
*   Triggered by low red to far-red light ratio.
*   Involves rapid stem elongation, upward leaf movement, accelerated flowering (driven by auxin increase).

---

### Thermoperiodism

*   Plant's response to daily temperature fluctuations.
*   Optimal growth often with day/night temperature difference.
*   Influences flowering, growth, development.

---

### Plant Movements

*   Variety of movements in response to environmental stimuli.
*   **Tropisms:** Directional growth movements.
    *   **Phototropism:** Towards light (auxin redistribution).
    *   **Gravitropism:** Towards/away from gravity (auxin regulation).
    *   **Thigmotropism:** Response to touch (e.g., vine coiling).
*   **Nastic Movements:** Non-directional movements.
    *   **Nyctinasty (Sleep Movements):** Daily leaf/flower opening/closing (circadian clock, turgor).
    *   **Thigmonasty:** Rapid response to touch (e.g., *Mimosa pudica* leaf folding, due to turgor changes).
