## Morphology and Anatomy of Frog (*Rana tigrina*)

### Morphology

*   **Body:** Head and trunk (no neck/tail).
*   **Skin:** Moist, smooth, slippery (mucus). Olive green dorsal, pale yellow ventral.
*   **Eyes:** Bulging, nictitating membrane.
*   **Ear:** Tympanum (eardrum).
*   **Limbs:** Two pairs. Forelimbs (4 digits), Hind limbs (5 webbed digits) for swimming/leaping.
*   **Sexual Dimorphism:** Males have vocal sacs and copulatory pads.

---

### Anatomy

#### 1. Digestive System

*   **Alimentary Canal:** Short (carnivores). Mouth → buccal cavity → pharynx → oesophagus → stomach → intestine → rectum → cloaca.
*   **Digestive Glands:** Liver (bile), Pancreas (pancreatic juice).
*   **Digestion:** Food captured by bilobed tongue. Digestion in stomach/intestine. Absorption by villi.

---

#### 2. Respiratory System

*   **In Water:** Skin (cutaneous respiration).
*   **On Land:** Buccal cavity, skin, lungs.
    *   **Lungs:** Pair of elongated, pink sacs (pulmonary respiration). Air via nostrils to buccal cavity then lungs.

---

#### 3. Circulatory System

*   **Type:** Closed.
*   **Heart:** Three-chambered (2 atria, 1 ventricle).
*   **Blood:** Plasma, RBCs (nucleated), WBCs, platelets.
*   **Circulation:** Incomplete double circulation (mixed blood pumped from single ventricle).
*   **Lymphatic System:** Lymph, lymph channels, lymph nodes.

---

#### 4. Excretory System

*   **Organs:** Kidneys (pair), ureters, cloaca, urinary bladder.
*   **Kidneys:** Compact, dark red, bean-like.
*   **Urine Formation:** Nitrogenous wastes (urea) excreted by kidneys. Frog is ureotelic.
*   **Excretory Pathway:** Ureters open into cloaca. In males, ureters are urinogenital ducts.

---

#### 5. Nervous System

*   **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Brain and spinal cord.
*   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Cranial and spinal nerves.
*   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Sympathetic and parasympathetic.
*   **Brain:** Fore-brain (olfactory lobes, cerebral hemispheres, diencephalon), Mid-brain (optic lobes), Hind-brain (cerebellum, medulla oblongata).

---

#### 6. Reproductive System

*   **Male:** Pair of testes. Vasa efferentia → kidneys → Bidder's canal → urinogenital duct → cloaca.
*   **Female:** Pair of ovaries. Oviducts open separately into cloaca. Lays 2500-3000 ova.
*   **Fertilization:** External, in water.
*   **Development:** Indirect, tadpole larva undergoes metamorphosis.
