# Respiration in Plants

## Chapter 4.2

---

## Introduction to Respiration

*   Metabolic process in all living organisms.
*   Releases energy from organic molecules (e.g., glucose).
*   Energy stored as ATP.

---

## Exchange of Gases (in Plants)

*   Primarily through:
    *   **Stomata:** Small pores on leaves.
    *   **Lenticels:** Pores on bark.
    *   **General surface of roots:** Younger roots absorb oxygen.
*   Plants respire day and night.

---

## Types of Respiration

1.  **Aerobic Respiration:**
    *   Occurs in presence of oxygen.
    *   Complete oxidation of organic substances.
    *   Releases large amount of energy.
2.  **Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation):**
    *   Occurs in absence of oxygen.
    *   Incomplete oxidation of organic substances.
    *   Releases smaller amount of energy.

---

## Cellular Respiration: An Overview

*   Complex process involving several stages:
    1.  **Glycolysis:** Cytoplasm.
    2.  **Krebs Cycle (TCA Cycle):** Mitochondrial matrix.
    3.  **Electron Transport System (ETS) / Oxidative Phosphorylation:** Inner mitochondrial membrane.

---

## Glycolysis (EMP Pathway)

*   First stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
*   Breaks down one glucose (6C) into two pyruvate (3C).
*   **Location:** Cytoplasm.
*   **Net Products (per glucose):**
    *   2 Pyruvate
    *   2 ATP (net gain)
    *   2 NADH

---

## Fermentation (Anaerobic Respiration)

*   Occurs when oxygen is unavailable after glycolysis.
*   Regenerates NAD+ from NADH.
*   **Alcoholic Fermentation:** Pyruvate → Acetaldehyde → Ethanol + CO₂ (Yeast).
*   **Lactic Acid Fermentation:** Pyruvate → Lactic Acid (Bacteria, muscle cells).
*   **Energy Yield:** Very little (only 2 ATP from glycolysis).

---

## Krebs Cycle (TCA Cycle / Citric Acid Cycle)

*   Central metabolic pathway in aerobic respiration.
*   **Location:** Mitochondrial matrix.
*   **Before Krebs Cycle:** Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA (oxidative decarboxylation).

---

### Key Steps of Krebs Cycle (per Acetyl-CoA)

*   Acetyl-CoA (2C) combines with Oxaloacetate (4C) to form Citrate (6C).
*   Series of reactions, releasing CO₂, producing NADH, FADH₂, and ATP (or GTP).
*   Oxaloacetate is regenerated.

---

### Net Products of Krebs Cycle (per glucose, i.e., 2 Acetyl-CoA)

*   6 NADH
*   2 FADH₂
*   2 ATP (or GTP)
*   4 CO₂

---

## Electron Transport System (ETS) and Oxidative Phosphorylation

*   Final stage of aerobic respiration, majority of ATP produced.
*   **Location:** Inner mitochondrial membrane.
*   NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to protein complexes.
*   Electrons move, protons (H+) pumped into intermembrane space, creating proton gradient.
*   Oxygen is final electron acceptor, forms water.

---

### Oxidative Phosphorylation

*   **Definition:** ATP synthesis using energy from NADH/FADH₂ oxidation (via ETS) to generate proton gradient, driving ATP synthase.
*   **Mechanism:** Proton gradient drives H+ back into matrix through ATP synthase, powering ATP synthesis.

---

## Energy Relations: ATP Yield

*   Theoretical maximum ATP yield from one glucose (aerobic respiration): **30-32 ATP**.

| Stage | ATP (Direct) | NADH | FADH₂ | ATP from NADH | ATP from FADH₂ | Total ATP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Glycolysis | 2 | 2 | 0 | 5 (or 3) | 0 | 7-5 |
| Pyruvate Oxidation (2x) | 0 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 5 |
| Krebs Cycle (2x) | 2 (GTP) | 6 | 2 | 15 | 3 | 20 |
| **Total** | **4** | **10** | **2** | **25** | **3** | **30-32** |

---

## Amphibolic Pathways

*   **Definition:** Metabolic pathways functioning in both catabolism (breakdown) and anabolism (synthesis).
*   **Example:** Krebs cycle.
    *   **Catabolic Role:** Breaks down Acetyl-CoA for energy.
    *   **Anabolic Role:** Intermediates (e.g., α-Ketoglutarate, Oxaloacetate, Succinyl-CoA) used as precursors for amino acids, glucose, chlorophyll, heme.

---

## Respiratory Quotient (RQ)

*   **Definition:** Ratio of CO₂ evolved to O₂ consumed during respiration.
    *   `RQ = Volume of CO₂ evolved / Volume of O₂ consumed`
*   **Significance:** Indicates type of respiratory substrate.

---

### RQ Values of Different Substrates

*   **Carbohydrates:** RQ = 1 (e.g., Glucose: 6CO₂ / 6O₂ = 1).
*   **Fats:** RQ < 1 (typically ~0.7). Require more O₂ for oxidation.
*   **Proteins:** RQ < 1 (typically ~0.8-0.9).
*   **Organic Acids:** RQ > 1 (e.g., Oxalic Acid: 8CO₂ / 1O₂ = 8). Require less external O₂.
*   **Anaerobic Respiration:** RQ = Infinity (∞). CO₂ evolved, no O₂ consumed.
