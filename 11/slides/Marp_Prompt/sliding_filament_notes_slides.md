# Sliding Filament Hypothesis and Muscle Contraction

---

## Introduction

*   Proposed by Hugh Huxley and Andrew Huxley (1954).
*   Explains how skeletal muscles generate force and shorten.
*   Involves interaction of actin and myosin proteins.

---

## Overview of Muscle Structure

### Hierarchical Organization

*   **Muscle** → **Muscle fascicles** → **Muscle fibers** → **Myofibrils** → **Sarcomeres**.
*   **Sarcomere:** Functional unit of muscle contraction.
*   Contains organized thick and thin filaments.

---

### Sarcomere Structure

*   Extends from one Z-disc to the next.
*   **Z-discs (Z-lines):** Anchor points for thin filaments.
*   **A-band:** Dark band, contains thick filaments (myosin).
*   **I-band:** Light band, contains only thin filaments (actin).
*   **H-zone:** Central region of A-band, only thick filaments.
*   **M-line:** Center of sarcomere, anchors thick filaments.

---

## The Sliding Filament Hypothesis

### Core Principle

*   Muscle contraction occurs when thin filaments (actin) slide past thick filaments (myosin).
*   Filaments do not change length; sarcomere shortens.

---

### Key Evidence Supporting the Hypothesis

1.  **Electron microscopy:** Filament lengths remain constant.
2.  **X-ray diffraction:** Spacing between filaments changes.
3.  **Light microscopy:** A-band width constant, I-band and H-zone narrow.

---

## Molecular Components

### Actin (Thin Filaments)

#### Structure:

*   **G-actin:** Globular monomeric form.
*   **F-actin:** Filamentous polymeric form (double helix of G-actin).
*   Each G-actin has a myosin-binding site.

---

#### Associated Proteins:

*   **Tropomyosin:** Rod-shaped, lies in grooves of actin helix.
*   **Troponin complex:** Three subunits:
    *   **Troponin C (TnC):** Calcium-binding.
    *   **Troponin I (TnI):** Inhibitory, blocks myosin-binding sites.
    *   **Troponin T (TnT):** Tropomyosin-binding.

---

### Myosin (Thick Filaments)

#### Structure:

*   **Myosin II:** Primary form in skeletal muscle.
*   **Heavy chains:** Form backbone and heads.
*   **Light chains:** Regulatory and essential.

---

#### Functional Domains:

*   **Head domain:** Actin-binding site and ATPase activity.
*   **Neck region:** Lever arm.
*   **Tail region:** Forms backbone of thick filaments.

---

#### Myosin Head Components:

*   **Actin-binding site.**
*   **ATP-binding site.**
*   **Light chain-binding region.**

---

## The Cross-Bridge Cycle

*   Cyclical process of myosin head interactions with actin filaments.

---

### Step 1: Cross-Bridge Formation

*   Myosin head in high-energy state (ADP + Pi bound).
*   Calcium exposes myosin-binding sites on actin.
*   Myosin head binds strongly to actin, forming cross-bridge.

---

### Step 2: Power Stroke

*   ADP and Pi release from myosin head.
*   Conformational change in myosin head (neck region rotation).
*   Actin filament moves relative to myosin (force generation).

---

### Step 3: ATP Binding and Cross-Bridge Detachment

*   New ATP molecule binds to myosin head.
*   Conformational change reduces actin affinity.
*   Cross-bridge detaches from actin.

---

### Step 4: ATP Hydrolysis and Reset

*   ATPase activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP + Pi.
*   Energy stored in myosin head (cocked position).
*   Myosin head ready for next cycle.

---

## Regulation of Muscle Contraction

### Calcium-Mediated Regulation

#### Excitation-Contraction Coupling:

1.  Action potential propagates along sarcolemma.
2.  T-tubules carry signal into muscle fiber.
3.  Sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored Ca²⁺.
4.  Ca²⁺ binding to troponin C causes conformational changes.

---

#### Molecular Mechanism:

*   **Resting state:** Tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites on actin.
*   **Calcium binding:** TnC changes conformation.
*   **Tropomyosin shift:** Moves, exposing myosin-binding sites.
*   **Cross-bridge cycling:** Contraction proceeds.

---

### Relaxation Process:

1.  Calcium reuptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum (via Ca²⁺-ATPase).
2.  Troponin-tropomyosin complex returns to inhibitory position.
3.  Cross-bridge cycling ceases.
4.  Muscle relaxation occurs.

---

## Types of Muscle Contractions

### Isotonic Contractions

*   **Concentric:** Muscle shortens while contracting.
*   **Eccentric:** Muscle lengthens while under tension.

---

### Isometric Contractions

*   Muscle generates force without changing length.
*   Cross-bridges cycle but no net sliding occurs.

---

## Energy Requirements

### ATP Functions in Muscle Contraction:

1.  Cross-bridge cycling.
2.  Calcium reuptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum.
3.  Sodium-potassium pump (maintains membrane potential).

---

### Energy Sources:

*   **Immediate:** Phosphocreatine system.
*   **Short-term:** Glycolysis.
*   **Long-term:** Oxidative phosphorylation.

---

## Clinical Significance

### Muscle Disorders Related to Contractile Proteins:

*   **Muscular dystrophies:** Defects in structural proteins.
*   **Myosin myopathies:** Mutations in myosin heavy chain genes.
*   **Actin myopathies:** Affect thin filaments.
*   **Rigor mortis:** ATP depletion prevents cross-bridge detachment.

---

### Pharmacological Targets:

*   **Calcium channel blockers:** Affect excitation-contraction coupling.
*   **Troponin inhibitors:** Potential cardiac therapeutics.
*   **Myosin inhibitors:** Treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
