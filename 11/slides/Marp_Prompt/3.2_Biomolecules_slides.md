# Biomolecules

## Chapter 3.2

---

## 1. Carbohydrates

*   Polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones, or their derivatives.
*   Primary energy source. Also known as saccharides.

---

### Classification of Carbohydrates

*   **Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars):** Cannot be hydrolyzed further. (CH₂O)n.
    *   **Glucose:** Hexose, primary energy source.
    *   **Ribose:** Pentose, component of RNA.
    *   **Deoxyribose:** Pentose, component of DNA.
*   **Disaccharides:** Two monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bond.
    *   **Maltose:** Glucose + Glucose (reducing).
    *   **Lactose:** Glucose + Galactose (reducing, milk sugar).
    *   **Sucrose:** Glucose + Fructose (non-reducing, cane sugar).
*   **Polysaccharides (Complex Carbohydrates):** Long chains of monosaccharides.
    *   **Glycogen:** Animal storage (liver, muscles).
    *   **Starch:** Plant storage (amylose, amylopectin).
    *   **Cellulose:** Plant cell wall (structural, indigestible by most animals).
    *   **Inulin:** Fructose polymer (prebiotic, fat substitute).
    *   **Chitin:** Exoskeletons, fungal cell walls (structural).

---

## 2. Proteins

*   Polymers of amino acids, linked by peptide bonds.
*   Most abundant organic molecules, wide range of functions.

---

### Amino Acids

*   Substituted methane: Carboxyl, amino, hydrogen, R group.
*   **Examples:** Glycine (simplest), Alanine, Serine.
*   **Zwitter-ion:** Molecule with both positive and negative charge.
*   **Types:** Acidic, Basic, Neutral, Sulphur-containing.
*   **Essential:** Must be obtained from diet (e.g., Lysine).
*   **Non-essential:** Can be synthesized by body (e.g., Glycine).

---

### Levels of Protein Structure

*   **Primary:** Linear sequence of amino acids.
*   **Secondary:** Polypeptide folded into α-helix or β-pleated sheet (stabilized by H-bonds).
*   **Tertiary:** Overall 3D shape (stabilized by various bonds).
*   **Quaternary:** Arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) (e.g., Haemoglobin).

---

### Functions of Proteins

*   **Enzymes:** Catalyze biochemical reactions.
*   **Structural:** Provide support (collagen, keratin).
*   **Transport:** Carry substances (hemoglobin).
*   **Hormones:** Regulate processes (insulin).
*   **Antibodies:** Defend against pathogens.

---

## 3. Lipids

*   Diverse organic compounds, insoluble in water, soluble in nonpolar solvents.

---

### Fats and Oils (Triglycerides)

*   Three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol.
*   **Fats:** Solid at room temp, animal origin, saturated fatty acids.
*   **Oils:** Liquid at room temp, plant origin, unsaturated fatty acids.
*   **Functions:** Energy storage, insulation, protection, source of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).

---

## 4. Enzymes

*   Biological catalysts.
*   Speed up biochemical reactions without being consumed.

---

### General Properties of Enzymes

*   Almost all are proteins.
*   Highly specific for substrates.
*   Work best at optimum temperature and pH.
*   Required in small amounts.

---

### Nomenclature and Classification

*   **Nomenclature:** Suffix "-ase" to substrate name (e.g., sucrase).
*   **Classification (6 classes by reaction type):**
    1.  Oxidoreductases (redox).
    2.  Transferases (transfer functional groups).
    3.  Hydrolases (hydrolysis).
    4.  Lyases (remove groups, form double bonds).
    5.  Isomerases (interconvert isomers).
    6.  Ligases (join molecules).

---

### Co-factors

*   Non-protein constituents bound to enzyme for activity.
*   **Prosthetic groups:** Tightly bound (e.g., heme).
*   **Co-enzymes:** Loosely bound (e.g., NAD, FAD).
*   **Metal ions:** Bridge between enzyme and substrate (e.g., Zn²⁺).

---

### Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

*   **Temperature:** Activity increases to optimum, then denatures.
*   **pH:** Each enzyme has an optimum pH.
*   **Substrate concentration:** Rate increases until saturation.
*   **Competitive Inhibitors:** Compete with substrate for active site (similar structure).

---

## 5. Secondary Metabolites

*   Organic compounds not directly involved in normal growth/reproduction.
*   By-products of metabolism, ecological functions.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Alkaloids:** Morphine, Codeine (pain relievers).
    *   **Terpenoids:** Menthol, Gibberellins.
    *   **Essential oils:** Lemon grass oil.
    *   **Toxins:** Abrin, Ricin.
    *   **Lectins:** Concanavalin A.
    *   **Drugs:** Vinblastin (anticancer), Curcumin (anti-inflammatory).
    *   **Polymeric substances:** Rubber, Gums, Cellulose.
