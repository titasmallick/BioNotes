# Plant Growth and Development

## Chapter 4.3

---

## 1. Seed Germination

*   Process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling.
*   Resumption of metabolic activities, emergence of radicle and plumule.

---

### Types of Germination

*   **Hypogeal Germination:** Epicotyl elongates, cotyledons remain below soil. (e.g., Pea, Maize).
*   **Epigeal Germination:** Hypocotyl elongates, cotyledons pushed above soil (may become photosynthetic). (e.g., Bean, Castor).
*   **Viviparous Germination:** Seeds germinate while still attached to parent plant (adaptation in mangroves, e.g., *Rhizophora*).

---

## 2. Growth

*   Irreversible and permanent increase in size, mass, or volume of a cell, organ, or organism.

---

### Phases of Growth in Meristems

*   **Meristematic Phase (Cell Division):** At apical meristems, continuous cell division.
*   **Elongation Phase:** Cells increase in size due to water absorption and cell wall material deposition.
*   **Maturation Phase:** Enlarged cells differentiate and mature for specific functions.

---

### Growth Rate

*   Increase in growth per unit time.
*   **Measurement:** Direct (length, area, volume, weight), Auxanometer (measures stem elongation).

---

### Factors Affecting Growth

*   **External Factors:** Light, temperature, water, oxygen, nutrients.
*   **Internal Factors:** Genetic factors, plant growth regulators (hormones).

---

## 3. Differentiation, Dedifferentiation, and Redifferentiation

*   **Differentiation:** Meristematic cells mature and specialize for specific functions (e.g., parenchyma, xylem).
*   **Dedifferentiation:** Permanent, differentiated cells regain power of cell division (e.g., formation of cambium from parenchyma).
*   **Redifferentiation:** Dedifferentiated cells lose division ability and mature into new specialized cells (e.g., secondary xylem/phloem from cambium).

---

## 4. Sequence of Developmental Processes in a Plant Cell

1.  **Cell Division:** Meristematic cell divides.
2.  **Cell Elongation:** New cell increases in size.
3.  **Cell Differentiation:** Cell specializes.
4.  **Cell Senescence:** Cell ages and dies.

---

## 5. Plant Hormones (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs)

*   Small molecules, diverse chemical composition.
*   Produced in one part, transported to others, regulate growth and development.

---

### Auxin

*   **Discovery:** Darwin (phototropism), F.W. Went (isolated from oat coleoptiles).
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   Apical Dominance (promotes apical bud, inhibits lateral).
    *   Cell Elongation.
    *   Root Initiation (in cuttings).
    *   Parthenocarpy (fruit development without fertilization).
*   **Application:** Rooting hormone, herbicide (2,4-D), induce pineapple flowering.

---

### Gibberellins (GAs)

*   **Discovery:** E. Kurosawa (abnormal tall growth in rice infected by *Gibberella fujikuroi*).
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   Stem Elongation (especially in dwarf plants).
    *   Bolting (internode elongation before flowering in rosette plants).
    *   Seed Germination (breaks dormancy, stimulates enzymes).
    *   Fruit Development (delays senescence, improves size/shape).
*   **Application:** Increase grape stalk length, promote malting, increase sugarcane yield.

---

### Cytokinins

*   **Discovery:** F. Skoog (callus proliferation with vascular tissue extracts), Kinetin isolated from herring sperm DNA.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   Cell Division (with auxins).
    *   Overcoming Apical Dominance (promotes lateral buds).
    *   Delaying Senescence (Richmond-Lang effect).
    *   Chloroplast Development.
*   **Application:** Tissue culture (cell division/differentiation), delay senescence of flowers/vegetables.

---

### Ethylene

*   **Discovery:** H.H. Cousins (volatile substance from ripe oranges hastened banana ripening).
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   Fruit Ripening.
    *   Senescence and Abscission (leaves, flowers, fruits).
    *   Horizontal Growth (seedlings), swelling of axis, apical hook formation.
    *   Flowering (pineapple, mango).
*   **Application:** Induce uniform fruit ripening, promote pineapple flowering, thinning of cotton/cherry/walnut.

---

### Abscisic Acid (ABA)

*   **Discovery:** Identified as inhibitor-B, abscission II, dormin.
*   **Physiological Effects:**
    *   Stomatal Closure (during water stress).
    *   Seed Dormancy (allows seeds to withstand unfavorable conditions).
    *   Abscission (leaves, flowers, fruits).
    *   Stress Hormone (increases tolerance to drought, salinity, temperature extremes).
*   **Application:** Induce seed dormancy for storage, promote fruit abscission for mechanical harvesting.
