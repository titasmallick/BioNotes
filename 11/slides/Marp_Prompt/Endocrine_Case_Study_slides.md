# Endocrine Case Files

## Stories from the Body's Chemical Command Center

---

## Introduction

*   The endocrine system guides our bodies through chemical messages (hormones).
*   Hormonal imbalances can dramatically impact health and life.
*   Case files illustrate the profound power of this system.

---

## The Ultimate Conductors: Hypothalamic Hormones

*   Hypothalamus directs entire endocrine system.
*   Uses releasing and inhibiting hormones to control pituitary.

---

### 1. Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH)

*   **Origin:** Hypothalamus.
*   **Action:** Stimulates **thyrotroph cells** of anterior pituitary to release TSH.
*   **Clinical Relevance:**
    *   Primary hypothyroidism: Low T4 → high TRH/TSH.
    *   Primary hyperthyroidism: Excess T4 → suppressed TRH/TSH.

---

### 2. Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)

*   **Origin:** Hypothalamus.
*   **Action:** Stimulates **corticotroph cells** of anterior pituitary to release ACTH.
*   **Clinical Relevance:**
    *   Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's): Lack of cortisol → high CRH/ACTH.
    *   Cortisol-producing adrenal tumor (Cushing's): Excess cortisol → suppressed CRH/ACTH.

---

### 3. Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)

*   **Origin:** Hypothalamus (released in pulses).
*   **Action:** Stimulates **gonadotroph cells** of anterior pituitary to release LH and FSH.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Kallmann Syndrome (failure of GnRH neuron migration) leads to absent puberty. Critical for reproductive axis.

---

### 4. Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) & Somatostatin (GHIH)

*   **Origin:** GHRH (hypothalamus), Somatostatin (hypothalamus).
*   **Action:** Push-pull effect on **somatotroph cells** of anterior pituitary. GHRH stimulates GH, Somatostatin inhibits GH.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Acromegaly (pituitary tumor secretes GH autonomously).

---

### 5. Dopamine (Prolactin-Inhibiting Hormone - PIH)

*   **Origin:** Hypothalamus.
*   **Action:** **Inhibitory** on **lactotroph cells** of anterior pituitary, preventing prolactin release.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Hyperprolactinemia (prolactin-secreting tumor, or anything blocking dopamine's effect).
