# The Living World

## Chapter 1.1

---

## What is Living?

*   Living organisms exhibit unique characteristics.

---

### Growth

*   Increase in mass and number of individuals.
*   **Living:** Intrinsic (from within), accumulation of material inside.
    *   Plants: Continuous growth.
    *   Animals: Growth up to a certain age.
*   **Non-living:** Extrinsic (accretion), accumulation on surface (e.g., mountains).
*   **Key Point:** Intrinsic growth is unique to living organisms.

---

### Reproduction

*   Producing offspring similar to themselves.
*   Ensures species continuity.
*   **Asexual:** Single parent, identical offspring (yeast budding, algae fragmentation).
*   **Sexual:** Two parents, genetic variation.
*   **Exceptions:** Mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples.
*   **Key Point:** Not a defining characteristic for *all* living organisms.

---

### Metabolism

*   Sum of all chemical reactions in an organism.
*   **Anabolism:** Synthesis (e.g., photosynthesis).
*   **Catabolism:** Breakdown (e.g., respiration).
*   **Key Point:** A *defining characteristic* of all living organisms.
    *   Metabolic reactions in vitro are living reactions, but not living things.

---

### Cellular Organization

*   All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
*   Cell is the fundamental unit of life.
*   **Unicellular:** Single cell (bacteria).
*   **Multicellular:** Many cells (tissues, organs).
*   **Key Point:** A *defining characteristic* of all living organisms.

---

### Consciousness

*   Ability to sense and respond to surroundings/stimuli.
*   Stimuli: Physical, chemical, biological.
*   **Self-consciousness:** Unique to humans.
*   **Key Point:** A *defining characteristic* of all living organisms.

---

## Conclusion: Defining Characteristics

*   Metabolism
*   Cellular Organization
*   Consciousness

---

## Diversity in the Living World

### Biodiversity

*   Total number and types of organisms on Earth.
*   **Estimated Species:** 1.7 to 1.8 million known.
*   Requires classification for effective study.

---

### Nomenclature (Binomial Nomenclature)

*   Giving scientific names to organisms.
*   Standardized, universally accepted.
*   **Carolus Linnaeus:** Proposed Binomial Nomenclature.
    *   **Generic name (Genus):** First word, capital letter.
    *   **Specific epithet (Species):** Second word, small letter.
*   **Rules:** Latin, italics (typed) or underlined (handwritten). Author name abbreviated.

---

### Identification

*   Determining if an organism is known or new.
*   Compares characteristics with known organisms.

---

### Classification

*   Grouping organisms into categories based on observable characteristics.
*   **Taxa (Taxon):** Scientific term for categories (e.g., plants, animals).
*   **Taxonomy:** Science of classification (characterization, identification, nomenclature, classification).
*   **Systematics:** Study of relationships and diversity, includes taxonomy and evolutionary relationships.

---

## Taxonomic Categories

*   Hierarchy of ranks/categories.

---

### Obligate Categories (Highest to Lowest)

*   **Kingdom:** Highest (e.g., Plantae, Animalia).
*   **Phylum (animals) / Division (plants):** Group of related classes (e.g., Chordata, Angiospermae).
*   **Class:** Group of related orders (e.g., Mammalia, Dicotyledoneae).
*   **Order:** Group of related families (e.g., Primata, Sapindales).
*   **Family:** Group of related genera (e.g., Hominidae, Solanaceae).
*   **Genus:** Group of related species (e.g., *Panthera*, *Solanum*).
*   **Species:** Lowest, fundamental unit; interbreeding to produce fertile offspring (e.g., *Homo sapiens*, *Mangifera indica*).

---

## Taxonomical Aids

*   Techniques, procedures, and stored information for identification and classification.

---

### Herbarium

*   Storehouse of dried, pressed, preserved plant specimens on sheets.
*   Quick referral system.
*   Label info: date, place, names, family, collector.

---

### Botanical Gardens

*   Collections of living plants for reference.
*   Identification, research, conservation, education.
*   Plants labeled with scientific name and family.
*   **Famous:** Kew (England), Indian Botanical Garden (Howrah).

---

### Museum

*   Collections of preserved plant and animal specimens.
*   Specimens in preservative solutions, dry, stuffed, or skeletons.

---

### Zoological Parks (Zoos)

*   Wild animals kept in protected environments under human care.
*   Study food habits, behavior, conservation, public viewing.

---

### Key

*   Taxonomical aid for identification based on similarities/dissimilarities.
*   Based on contrasting characters (couplet), choice between two options.
*   Each statement is a 'lead'. Analytical in nature.

---

### Monograph

*   Comprehensive information on any one taxon.

---

### Manual

*   Information for identification of species in a specific area.

---

### Flora

*   Actual account of habitat and distribution of plants of a given area.
*   Index to plant species in a particular area.

---

### Catalogue

*   List or register enumerating all species in an area with brief descriptions.
