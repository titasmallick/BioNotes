# The Cardiac Cycle

## A Comprehensive Study Guide

---

## Introduction

*   Sequence of events in heart during one heartbeat.
*   Involves contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) of atria and ventricles.
*   Normal heart rate (~75 bpm): cycle ~0.8 seconds.

---

## Phases of the Cardiac Cycle

*   Primarily discussed in terms of ventricular activity.

---

### 1. Atrial Systole (0.1 seconds)

*   **Event:** Atria contract.
*   **Action:** Pushes final ~30% of blood into relaxed ventricles.
*   **Valves:** AV valves **open**, Semilunar valves **closed**.
*   **ECG:** Just after P wave.

---

### 2. Ventricular Systole (0.3 seconds)

#### a. Isovolumetric Contraction (0.05 seconds)

*   **Event:** Ventricles begin to contract.
*   **Action:** Ventricular pressure rises, no change in blood volume (all valves closed).
*   **Valves:** All valves **closed**.
*   **Heart Sound:** First heart sound, **S1 ("LUB")**, due to AV valve closure.

---

#### b. Ventricular Ejection (0.25 seconds)

*   **Event:** Ventricular pressure > aortic/pulmonary artery pressure.
*   **Action:** Semilunar valves open, blood forcefully ejected.
*   **Valves:** Semilunar valves **open**, AV valves **closed**.
*   **ECG:** Starts after QRS complex.

---

### 3. Ventricular Diastole (0.5 seconds)

*   Relaxation phase of ventricles.

---

#### a. Isovolumetric Relaxation (0.08 seconds)

*   **Event:** Ventricles relax.
*   **Action:** Ventricular pressure falls rapidly, volume unchanged.
*   **Valves:** All valves **closed**.
*   **Heart Sound:** Second heart sound, **S2 ("DUB")**, due to semilunar valve closure.

---

#### b. Rapid Filling Phase (0.11 seconds)

*   **Event:** Ventricular pressure drops below atrial pressure.
*   **Action:** AV valves open, blood rushes into ventricles.
*   **Valves:** AV valves **open**.

---

#### c. Slow Filling / Diastasis (0.19 seconds)

*   **Event:** Ventricle filling continues slowly.
*   **Action:** Both atria and ventricles relaxed. Sets stage for next atrial systole.

---

## Key Concepts

### Joint Diastole (Complete Diastole)

*   Period when both atria and ventricles are relaxed.
*   **Duration:** ~0.4 seconds (longest phase).
*   **Importance:** Primary "refill and reset" phase; coronary arteries receive most blood flow.

---

### Dicrotic Notch (Incisura)

*   Small, brief dip in aortic pressure curve after aortic valve closes.
*   **Cause:** Momentary backflow of blood against closed aortic valve.
*   **Significance:** Marks aortic valve closure, associated with S2.

---

## Heart Sounds: "Lub" and "Dub"

*   Caused by closure of heart valves.
*   **S1 ("Lub"):** Closure of **AV valves** (mitral and tricuspid) at beginning of ventricular systole.
*   **S2 ("Dub"):** Closure of **semilunar valves** (aortic and pulmonary) at beginning of ventricular diastole.

---

## The Aortic Pressure Curve

*   Graph showing pressure changes in aorta during cardiac cycle.
*   **Peak Aortic Pressure:** Highest pressure during ventricular ejection (~120 mmHg) = **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)**.
*   **Dicrotic Notch:** Small dip after aortic valve closure.
*   **Diastolic Pressure:** Lowest pressure before next ejection (~80 mmHg) = **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)**.

## Clinical Correlations and Fun Facts

*   Atrial contraction contributes only ~20-30% of ventricular filling; rest is passive.
*   Heart spends more time in diastole than systole, crucial for coronary blood supply.
*   During exercise, diastole shortens more significantly than systole.
