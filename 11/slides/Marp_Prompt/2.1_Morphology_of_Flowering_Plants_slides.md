# Morphology of Flowering Plants

## Chapter 2.1

---

## 1. The Root

*   Non-green, underground, positively geotropic, negatively phototropic.
*   Develops from radicle.

---

### Regions of the Root

*   **Root Cap:** Covers apex, protects meristem.
*   **Region of Meristematic Activity:** Actively dividing cells.
*   **Region of Elongation:** Cells elongate, responsible for length growth.
*   **Region of Maturation:** Cells differentiate, bear root hairs (absorb water/minerals).

---

### Types of Root Systems

*   **Tap Root System:** Main primary root, lateral branches. Characteristic of dicots (e.g., Mustard, Carrot).
*   **Fibrous Root System:** Primary root short-lived, replaced by many thin roots from stem base. Characteristic of monocots (e.g., Wheat, Grass).
*   **Adventitious Root System:** Roots arise from parts other than radicle (stem, leaves). (e.g., Grass, Banyan tree).

---

### Modifications of Root (For Storage)

*   **Tap Roots:**
    *   **Conical:** Carrot.
    *   **Fusiform:** Radish.
    *   **Napiform:** Turnip.
*   **Adventitious Roots:**
    *   **Tuberous:** Sweet Potato.

---

### Modifications of Root (For Support)

*   **Prop Roots:** Grow vertically downwards from branches, provide support (e.g., Banyan tree).
*   **Stilt Roots:** Thick, oblique roots from lower stem nodes, provide extra support (e.g., Maize, Sugarcane).

---

### Modifications of Root (For Respiration)

*   **Pneumatophores:** Grow vertically upwards from soil in mangroves, have pores for air diffusion (e.g., *Rhizophora*).

---

## 2. The Stem

*   Ascending part of plant axis, develops from plumule.
*   Bears branches, leaves, flowers, fruits.
*   **Nodes:** Where leaves are borne.
*   **Internodes:** Portions between nodes.
*   **Buds:** Young, immature shoots (terminal or axillary).

---

### Modifications of Stem (Underground)

*   For Storage and Perennation.
*   **Tuber:** Swollen tip, stores food, bears buds (e.g., Potato).
*   **Rhizome:** Prostrate, horizontal, underground stem (e.g., Ginger, Turmeric).
*   **Corm:** Condensed, fleshy, vertical, underground stem (e.g., *Colocasia*).

---

### Modifications of Stem (Sub-aerial)

*   For Vegetative Propagation.
*   **Runner:** Slender, prostrate branch, roots at nodes (e.g., Grass, *Oxalis*).
*   **Stolon:** Slender lateral branch, arches downwards (e.g., Strawberry, Mint).
*   **Sucker:** Lateral branch from underground, grows obliquely upwards (e.g., Banana, Pineapple).
*   **Offset:** Lateral branch with short internodes, rosette of leaves, tuft of roots (aquatic plants, e.g., *Pistia*).

---

### Modifications of Stem (Aerial)

*   **Stem Tendrils:** Slender, coiled, for climbing (e.g., Gourds, Grapevines).
*   **Thorns:** Woody, pointed, for protection (e.g., *Citrus*, *Bougainvillea*).
*   **Phylloclade:** Flattened/fleshy green stem for photosynthesis (e.g., *Opuntia*, *Euphorbia*).
*   **Cladode:** Green, flattened/cylindrical stem of limited growth for photosynthesis (e.g., *Asparagus*).

---

## 3. The Leaf

*   Lateral, flattened, green structure on stem at node.
*   Primarily for photosynthesis.

---

### Parts of a Simple Leaf

*   **Leaf Base:** Attached to stem.
*   **Petiole:** Stalk connecting blade to stem.
*   **Lamina (Leaf Blade):** Broad, green part with veins/veinlets.

---

### Venation

*   Arrangement of veins/veinlets in lamina.
*   **Reticulate Venation:** Veinlets form network (dicots).
*   **Parallel Venation:** Veins run parallel (monocots).

---

### Types of Leaves

*   **Simple Leaf:** Lamina entire, incisions don't touch midrib (e.g., Mango).
*   **Compound Leaf:** Lamina incisions reach midrib, forming leaflets.
    *   **Pinnately Compound:** Leaflets on common axis (rachis) (e.g., Neem).
    *   **Palmately Compound:** Leaflets attached at tip of petiole (e.g., Silk Cotton).

---

### Phyllotaxy

*   Pattern of leaf arrangement on stem/branch.
*   **Alternate:** Single leaf at each node, alternate manner (e.g., China rose).
*   **Opposite:** Pair of leaves at each node, opposite (e.g., *Calotropis*).
*   **Whorled:** More than two leaves at a node, form a whorl (e.g., *Alstonia*).

---

### Modifications of Leaves

*   **For Mechanical Support (Tendrils):** Entire leaf/part modified for climbing (e.g., Peas).
*   **For Protection (Spines):** Hard, sharp, reduce water loss, protect (e.g., Cacti).
*   **For Storage (Bulb):** Fleshy, store food (e.g., Onion).
*   **For Reproduction:** Adventitious buds on leaves form new plants (e.g., *Bryophyllum*).
*   **Insectivorous Plants:**
    *   **Pitcher Plant:** Lamina modified into pitcher to trap insects.
    *   **Venus-fly-trap:** Leaf modified into snapping trap.

---

## 4. Inflorescence

*   Arrangement of flowers on the floral axis (peduncle).

---

### Types of Inflorescence

*   **Racemose:** Main axis grows indefinitely, flowers acropetal succession (older at base, younger at apex) (e.g., Radish, Mustard).
*   **Cymose:** Main axis terminates in a flower, limited growth, flowers basipetal order (older at apex, younger at base) (e.g., Jasmine, *Calotropis*).

---

### Differences: Racemose vs. Cymose

| Feature | Racemose | Cymose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Main Axis | Continues to grow | Terminates in a flower |
| Flower Arrangement | Acropetal | Basipetal |
| Opening of Flowers | Centripetal | Centrifugal |

---

## 5. The Flower

*   Reproductive unit in angiosperms for sexual reproduction.
*   Four whorls: Calyx, Corolla, Androecium, Gynoecium.

---

### Flower Terminology

*   **Bracteate:** With bracts.
*   **Ebracteate:** Without bracts.
*   **Symmetry:**
    *   **Actinomorphic (Radial):** Divided into equal halves in any radial plane (e.g., Mustard).
    *   **Zygomorphic (Bilateral):** Divided into similar halves in only one vertical plane (e.g., Pea).
*   **Floral Appendages:** Trimerous (multiples of 3), Tetramerous (4), Pentamerous (5).
*   **Completeness:** Complete (all 4 whorls), Incomplete (lacking whorls).

---

### Non-Essential Whorls (Accessory)

*   **Calyx:** Outermost, sepals (protect bud).
    *   Gamosepalous (fused), Polysepalous (free).
*   **Corolla:** Inner to calyx, petals (attract pollinators).
    *   Gamopetalous (fused), Polypetalous (free).
*   **Perianth:** Calyx and corolla not distinct (e.g., Lily). Individual units: tepals.

---

### Aestivation

*   Arrangement of sepals/petals in floral bud.
*   **Valvate:** Just touch at margin (e.g., *Calotropis*).
*   **Twisted:** One margin overlaps next (e.g., China rose).
*   **Imbricate:** Overlap, no particular direction (e.g., *Cassia*).
*   **Vexillary (Papilionaceous):** Largest standard, two wings, two keel (e.g., Pea).

---

### Essential Whorls (Reproductive)

*   **Androecium (Stamen):** Male part (filament + anther).
    *   **Cohesion of Stamens:** Monadelphous (one bundle), Diadelphous (two bundles), Polyadelphous (more than two). Syngenesious (anthers united), Synandrous (filaments & anthers united).
    *   **Adhesion of Stamens:** Epipetalous (to petals), Epiphyllous (to perianth).
