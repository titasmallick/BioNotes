# Locomotion and Movement

## Chapter 5.4

---

## 1. Types of Movement

*   Movement: Change in position of body part or whole organism.
*   Locomotion: Movement resulting in change of place/location.

---

### Types of Movement

*   **Ciliary Movement:** Coordinated movement of cilia (e.g., trachea, oviduct).
*   **Flagellar Movement:** Movement using flagella (e.g., spermatozoa, *Euglena*).
*   **Muscular Movement:** Contraction/relaxation of muscles (e.g., limbs, jaws, locomotion).

---

## 2. Muscles

### a) General Properties of Muscles

*   **Excitability:** Respond to stimulus.
*   **Contractility:** Shorten forcefully.
*   **Extensibility:** Be stretched.
*   **Elasticity:** Recoil to original length.

---

### b) Structure of Skeletal Muscle

*   **Muscle Bundles (Fascicles):** Held by fascia.
*   **Muscle Fibres (Cells):** Within bundles.
    *   **Sarcolemma:** Plasma membrane.
    *   **Sarcoplasm:** Cytoplasm, many nuclei (syncytium).
    *   **Sarcoplasmic Reticulum:** Storehouse of Ca²⁺.
*   **Myofilaments/Myofibrils:** Parallel filaments in sarcoplasm.
    *   **I-band (Light):** Contains actin (thin filament), bisected by Z-line.
    *   **A-band (Dark):** Contains myosin (thick filament).
    *   **Sarcomere:** Functional unit, between two Z-lines.
    *   **H-zone:** Lighter region in center of A-band.
    *   **M-line:** Thin dark line in center of H-zone.

---

### c) Contractile Proteins

*   **Actin (Thin Filament):**
    *   Two 'F' (filamentous) actins helically wound.
    *   'F' actin is polymer of 'G' (Globular) actins.
    *   **Tropomyosin:** Two filaments run along 'F' actins.
    *   **Troponin:** Complex protein, masks myosin binding sites on actin in resting state.
*   **Myosin (Thick Filament):**
    *   Polymerized protein, many **Meromyosins**.
    *   Each meromyosin: globular head (HMM) + tail (LMM).
    *   HMM forms **cross arm**.
    *   Globular head: ATPase enzyme, binding sites for ATP and actin.

---

### d) Sliding Filament Theory of Muscle Contraction

*   Thin filaments (actin) slide over thick filaments (myosin).
    1.  CNS signal via motor neuron to neuromuscular junction.
    2.  **Acetylcholine** release generates action potential in sarcolemma.
    3.  Action potential spreads, causes Ca²⁺ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum into sarcoplasm.
    4.  Ca²⁺ binds to troponin, unmasking myosin binding sites on actin.
    5.  Myosin head binds to actin, forming **cross bridge** (uses ATP hydrolysis).
    6.  Myosin pulls actin towards A-band center, shortening sarcomere (**contraction**).
    7.  I-bands reduce, A-bands retain length, H-zone disappears.
    8.  Myosin releases ADP/Pi, new ATP binds, cross-bridge breaks. Cycle repeats.
    9.  Ca²⁺ pumped back to sarcoplasmic reticulum, actin sites masked, muscle **relaxation**.

---

### e) Chemical Events During Muscle Contraction

*   **ATP Hydrolysis:** `ATP → ADP + Pi + Energy` (for power stroke).
*   **Creatine Phosphate:** `Creatine Phosphate + ADP → Creatine + ATP` (replenishes ATP).

---

### f) Definitions

*   **Summation:** Second contraction stronger if stimulated before complete relaxation.
*   **Tetanus:** Smooth, sustained contraction from high-frequency stimulation.
*   **Rigor Mortis:** Stiffening after death due to ATP depletion (prevents cross-bridge detachment).

### g) Red and White Muscles

| Feature | Red Muscles (Slow Twitch) | White Muscles (Fast Twitch) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Myoglobin Content | High | Low |
| Mitochondria | Numerous | Few |
| Sarcoplasmic Reticulum | Less | More |
| Contraction Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Fatigue | Resistant | Prone to fatigue |
| Example | Extensor muscles of back | Muscles of the eyeball |

## 3. Skeletal System

### a) Functions of the Human Skeleton

1.  Provides framework.
2.  Supports and protects internal organs.
3.  Surface for muscle attachment.
4.  Role in breathing (rib cage).
5.  Stores minerals (calcium, phosphorus).
6.  Produces blood cells (bone marrow).

---

### b) Human Skeleton

*   206 bones.
*   Divided into Axial and Appendicular skeleton.

---

#### i) Axial Skeleton (80 bones)

*   **Skull (22):** Cranial (8), Facial (14).
*   **Hyoid Bone (1):** U-shaped, base of buccal cavity.
*   **Ear Ossicles (6):** Malleus (2), Incus (2), Stapes (2).
*   **Vertebral Column (26):** Cervical (7), Thoracic (12), Lumbar (5), Sacrum (1), Coccyx (1).
*   **Sternum (1):** Flat bone, ventral midline.
*   **Ribs (12 pairs):** True (1-7), False (8-10), Floating (11-12).

---

#### ii) Appendicular Skeleton (126 bones)

*   **Pectoral Girdle (4):** Clavicle (2), Scapula (2).
*   **Upper Limbs (60):** Humerus (2), Radius (2), Ulna (2), Carpals (16), Metacarpals (10), Phalanges (28).

## 4. Joints

*   Points of contact between bones, or bones and cartilages.
*   Essential for movement.

---

### Types of Joints

*   **Fibrous Joints (Immovable):** No movement (e.g., skull sutures).
*   **Cartilaginous Joints (Slightly Movable):** Bones joined by cartilage, limited movement (e.g., vertebrae).
*   **Synovial Joints (Freely Movable):** Fluid-filled synovial cavity, considerable movement.
    *   Ball and Socket (shoulder), Hinge (knee), Pivot (atlas/axis), Gliding (carpals), Saddle (thumb).

## 5. Disorders of Muscular and Skeletal System

*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Autoimmune, affects neuromuscular junction, muscle fatigue/weakness/paralysis.
*   **Tetany:** Rapid muscle spasms due to low Ca²⁺.
*   **Muscular Dystrophy:** Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle (genetic).
*   **Arthritis:** Inflammation of joints.
*   **Osteoporosis:** Age-related, decreased bone mass, increased fractures (low estrogen).
*   **Gout:** Joint inflammation due to uric acid crystal accumulation.
