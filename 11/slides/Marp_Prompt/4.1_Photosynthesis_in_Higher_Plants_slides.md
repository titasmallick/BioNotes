# Photosynthesis in Higher Plants

## Chapter 4.1

---

## Introduction to Photosynthesis

*   Process by which green plants, algae, some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose).
*   Primary means of autotrophic nutrition.
*   **Equation:** 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

---

## Site of Photosynthesis

*   Occurs in **chloroplasts**, primarily in mesophyll cells of leaves.

---

### Chloroplast Structure

*   **Double Membrane:** Outer and inner.
*   **Stroma:** Dense fluid, contains enzymes, ribosomes, DNA. Site of biosynthetic phase (Calvin cycle).
*   **Thylakoids:** Interconnected membranous sacs.
*   **Grana:** Stacks of thylakoids. Site of photochemical phase.
*   **Lumen:** Fluid inside thylakoid.

---

## Pigments Involved in Photosynthesis

*   Molecules that absorb light energy.
*   **Chlorophyll a:** Primary pigment, bluish-green.
*   **Chlorophyll b:** Accessory pigment, yellowish-green, passes energy to chlorophyll a.
*   **Carotenoids:** Accessory pigments (yellow, orange, red), protect chlorophyll from photodamage.
*   **Xanthophylls:** Type of carotenoid, yellow.

### Differences between Chlorophyll 'a' and 'b'

| Feature | Chlorophyll 'a' | Chlorophyll 'b' |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color** | Bluish-green | Yellowish-green |
| **Role** | Primary | Accessory |
| **Methyl Group** | At C7 position | Formyl group at C7 position |
| **Absorption Peak** | 430 nm, 662 nm | 453 nm, 642 nm |

---

### Absorption and Action Spectra

*   **Absorption Spectrum:** Graph showing light absorbed by pigment at different wavelengths.
*   **Action Spectrum:** Graph showing rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths. The action spectrum closely matches chlorophyll absorption, indicating chlorophylls are primary pigments.

---

## Phases of Photosynthesis

1.  **Photochemical Phase (Light-Dependent Reactions):**
    *   Occurs in thylakoid membranes.
    *   Light absorption, water splitting, O₂ release, ATP and NADPH formation.
2.  **Biosynthetic Phase (Light-Independent Reactions/Calvin Cycle):**
    *   Occurs in stroma.
    *   CO₂ fixation, glucose synthesis, using ATP and NADPH.

---

## Photochemical Phase

### Pigment Systems (Photosystems)

*   Protein complexes in thylakoid membranes.
*   **Photosystem I (PS I):** Reaction center P700 (absorbs 700 nm). Involved in cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.
*   **Photosystem II (PS II):** Reaction center P680 (absorbs 680 nm). Involved only in non-cyclic photophosphorylation.

---

### Photophosphorylation

*   Synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using light energy.

---

#### Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation

1.  PS II (P680) absorbs light, electrons released.
2.  Electrons pass through ETC to PS I, creating proton gradient (ATP synthesis).
3.  Water splitting (photolysis) replaces PS II electrons, releases H⁺ and O₂.
4.  PS I (P700) absorbs light, electrons released.
5.  Electrons reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH.
*   Produces both ATP and NADPH.

---

#### Cyclic Photophosphorylation

1.  Only PS I involved.
2.  Electrons from P700 cycle back to P700 through ETC.
3.  Generates ATP only, no NADPH.
4.  Occurs when high ATP demand or NADP⁺ unavailable.

---

### Chemiosmotic Hypothesis

*   Explains ATP synthesis.
*   Proton pumping into thylakoid lumen creates proton gradient.
*   Protons flow back to stroma through ATP synthase.
*   Energy from proton flow used to synthesize ATP.

---

## Biosynthetic Phase (Calvin Cycle)

*   Series of biochemical reactions in chloroplast stroma.
*   Also known as C3 cycle.

---

### Steps of the Calvin Cycle

1.  **Carboxylation:** CO₂ + RuBP (5C) → 2 molecules of 3-PGA (3C). Catalyzed by RuBisCO.
2.  **Reduction:** 3-PGA converted to G3P using ATP and NADPH.
3.  **Regeneration:** RuBP regenerated from G3P, requires ATP.
*   One G3P used for glucose, five for RuBP regeneration.

---

## Photorespiration

*   Wasteful process in C3 plants when CO₂ is low, O₂ is high.
*   **Pathway:** RuBisCO binds O₂ instead of CO₂, produces 3-PGA and phosphoglycolate. Phosphoglycolate broken down, releasing CO₂.
*   **Significance:** Consumes ATP, releases CO₂. Considered wasteful, but may protect against photo-oxidative damage.
*   **RuBisCO as an Oxygenase:** Active site binds both CO₂ and O₂.

---

## C4 Pathway (Hatch and Slack Pathway)

*   Adaptation of some plants to hot, dry climates.
*   Minimizes photorespiration by concentrating CO₂.

---

### Kranz Anatomy

*   Specialized leaf anatomy in C4 plants.
*   Vascular bundles surrounded by large bundle sheath cells, which are in turn surrounded by mesophyll cells.

---

### Steps of the C4 Pathway

1.  **Mesophyll cells:** CO₂ fixed by PEP carboxylase → oxaloacetate (4C).
2.  Oxaloacetate converted to malate/aspartate, transported to bundle sheath cells.
3.  **Bundle sheath cells:** 4C compound broken down, releasing CO₂.
4.  CO₂ fixed by RuBisCO in Calvin cycle.

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

### Blackman's Law of Limiting Factors

*   Rate of physiological process limited by factor in shortest supply.
*   **Example:** If light/water abundant but CO₂ low, CO₂ limits photosynthesis.

---

### Factors

*   **Light:** Rate increases with intensity up to a point.
*   **Carbon Dioxide:** Rate increases with concentration up to a point.
*   **Temperature:** Rate increases to optimum, then decreases.
*   **Water:** Essential. Lack of water closes stomata, reduces CO₂ intake.
