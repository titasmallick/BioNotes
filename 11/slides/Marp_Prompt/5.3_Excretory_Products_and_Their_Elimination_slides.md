# Excretory Products and Their Elimination

## Chapter 5.3

---

## 1. Homeostasis

*   **Definition:** Maintenance of a constant internal environment of the body.
*   Includes constant temperature, pH, water, salt concentrations.
*   Excretory system crucial for osmoregulation.

---

## 2. Modes of Excretion

*   Removal of harmful metabolic wastes (ammonia, urea, uric acid, CO₂, etc.).

---

### Ammonotelism (Excretion of Ammonia)

*   **Definition:** Excreting ammonia.
*   **Explanation:** Ammonia is highly toxic, requires large water for elimination. Common in aquatic animals.
*   **Examples:** Bony fishes, aquatic amphibians, aquatic insects.

---

### Ureotelism (Excretion of Urea)

*   **Definition:** Excreting urea.
*   **Explanation:** Ammonia converted to less toxic urea in liver. Requires moderate water.
*   **Examples:** Mammals, terrestrial amphibians, marine fishes.

---

### Uricotelism (Excretion of Uric Acid)

*   **Definition:** Excreting uric acid.
*   **Explanation:** Uric acid is least toxic, excreted with minimum water loss (paste/pellet). Adaptation for water conservation.
*   **Examples:** Reptiles, birds, land snails, insects.

---

## 3. Human Excretory System

### a) Structure of the Human Excretory System

*   Pair of kidneys.
*   Pair of ureters.
*   Urinary bladder.
*   Urethra.

---

### b) Structure of the Kidney

*   **External:** Reddish-brown, bean-shaped. Hilum (notch for entry/exit of vessels, nerves, ureter).
*   **Internal (L.S.):**
    *   **Cortex:** Outer, darker region.
    *   **Medulla:** Inner, lighter region, divided into medullary pyramids projecting into calyces.
    *   **Columns of Bertini:** Cortical extensions between medullary pyramids.

---

### c) Structure of a Nephron

*   **Definition:** Functional unit of the kidney (~1 million per kidney).
*   **Parts:**
    1.  **Glomerulus:** Tuft of capillaries (afferent arteriole in, efferent arteriole out).
    2.  **Bowman's Capsule:** Double-walled, cup-like, encloses glomerulus.
        *   **Malpighian body/Renal corpuscle:** Glomerulus + Bowman's capsule.
    3.  **Renal Tubule:**
        *   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** Highly coiled.
        *   **Henle’s Loop:** Hairpin-shaped (descending and ascending limbs).
        *   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):** Highly coiled.
        *   **Collecting Duct:** Receives from many DCTs.

---

## 4. Physiology of Urine Formation

*   Three main processes in different parts of nephron:
    1.  Glomerular filtration.
    2.  Reabsorption.
    3.  Secretion.

---

### a) Glomerular Filtration (Ultrafiltration)

*   **Process:** Blood filtered by glomerulus through 3 layers (endothelium, epithelium, basement membrane). Plasma constituents (except proteins) pass into Bowman's capsule.
*   **GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate):** Amount of filtrate formed per minute (~125 ml/min or 180 L/day in healthy individual).

---

### b) Selective Reabsorption

*   Nearly 99% of filtrate reabsorbed by renal tubules.
*   **PCT:** Reabsorbs essential nutrients, 70-80% electrolytes and water.
*   **Henle's Loop:** Minimum reabsorption in ascending limb, maintains medullary interstitial fluid osmolarity.
*   **DCT:** Conditional reabsorption of Na+ and water.
*   **Collecting Duct:** Large amount of water reabsorbed to produce concentrated urine.

---

### c) Tubular Secretion

*   Tubular cells secrete H+, K+, ammonia into filtrate.
*   Helps maintain ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.

---

## 5. Counter-Current Mechanism

*   **Function:** Produces concentrated urine in mammals.
*   Involves Henle’s loop and vasa recta (capillary network parallel to loop).
*   **Mechanism:** Opposite flow of filtrate in Henle's loop and blood in vasa recta creates concentration gradient in medullary interstitium, facilitating water reabsorption from collecting tubule.

---

## 6. Regulation of Kidney Function

### a) Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) / Vasopressin

*   **Source:** Hypothalamus, released from posterior pituitary.
*   **Function:** Facilitates water reabsorption from DCT and collecting duct, preventing diuresis. Released when fluid loss is high.

---

### b) Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)

*   **Activation:** Fall in glomerular blood flow/pressure/GFR activates JG cells to release **renin**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Renin converts angiotensinogen → angiotensin I.
    2.  Angiotensin I → angiotensin II (by ACE).
    3.  **Angiotensin II:** Vasoconstrictor (increases BP, GFR), activates adrenal cortex to release **Aldosterone**.
    4.  **Aldosterone:** Reabsorbs Na+ and water from tubules (increases BP, GFR).

---

### c) Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF)

*   **Source:** Walls of heart atria.
*   **Function:** Released when blood flow to atria increases. Causes vasodilation, decreases blood pressure. Acts as a check on RAAS.

---

### d) Micturition

*   **Definition:** Process of urine release from urinary bladder.
*   **Regulation:** Bladder stretching signals CNS → CNS sends motor messages → bladder smooth muscles contract, urethral sphincter relaxes → urine released.

---

### e) Role of Erythropoietin

*   **Source:** Juxtaglomerular cells of kidney.
*   **Function:** Hormone stimulating erythropoiesis (RBC formation) in bone marrow.

---

## 7. Role of Other Organs in Excretion

*   **Lungs:** Remove large amounts of CO₂ and water.
*   **Liver:** Secretes bile-containing substances (bilirubin, cholesterol, etc.) into digestive wastes.
*   **Skin:** Sweat glands (NaCl, urea, lactic acid), sebaceous glands (sterols, hydrocarbons, waxes).

---

## 8. Disorders of the Excretory System

*   **Uraemia:** Urea accumulation in blood, leads to kidney failure.
*   **Renal Failure:** Kidneys stop functioning.
*   **Renal Calculi:** Kidney stones (crystallized salts).
*   **Nephritis:** Inflammation of kidneys (glomerulonephritis).

---

### a) Haemodialysis (Artificial Kidney)

*   **Process:** Blood from artery, heparin added, pumped into dialyzing unit.
*   Dialyzing fluid has no nitrogenous wastes.
*   Porous cellophane membrane allows wastes to diffuse out.
*   Cleared blood (with anti-heparin) returned to body via vein.

---

### b) Kidney Transplant

*   Ultimate method for acute renal failure.
*   Functioning kidney from donor (preferably close relative) transplanted.
*   Minimizes rejection by immune system.
