# CISCE Syllabus and Assessment Guidelines

## Understanding the CISCE Biology Syllabus (Classes 6-12): Key Guidelines for Assessment

A thorough understanding of the CISCE Biology syllabus is fundamental to designing effective and relevant assessments. The syllabus provides a clear roadmap for educators, outlining the key concepts and learning objectives for each grade level. By aligning our question papers with the syllabus, we can ensure that we are assessing the knowledge and skills that are most critical for student success.

### Syllabus Structure & Developmental Progression

The CISCE Biology syllabus is carefully structured to reflect the cognitive development of students, with topics that progressively increase in complexity from one grade to the next:

- **Class 6-8:** At this stage, the focus is on foundational concepts such as plant life, the cell, the human body, health and hygiene, and adaptation.
- **Class 9-12:** In the higher grades, the syllabus delves into more advanced topics, including reproduction, genetics, evolution, biotechnology, and ecology.

This variation in content and complexity necessitates the use of grade-specific assessment strategies. The questions must be aligned with the specific learning objectives and cognitive demands of each class level to ensure that they are both challenging and appropriate.

### CISCE’s Dual Focus: Theory & Practical Application

CISCE assessments place a strong emphasis on both theoretical understanding and the development of practical skills:

**ISC Class 12:**

- **70 marks** → Theory
- **30 marks** → Practical (including experiments, project work, and a practical file)

**ICSE Class 10:**

- **80 marks** → Theory
- **20 marks** → Internal practical assessment

This dual focus highlights the need for balanced question papers that can effectively test a student's:

- Conceptual clarity
- Ability to apply knowledge
- Skills in experimental interpretation
- Scientific inquiry skills

### Shift Towards Competency-Based Assessment (From 2025)

In alignment with the principles of the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**, CISCE is transitioning towards a model of competency-based assessment. This shift is reflected in the following changes, which will be implemented from 2025 onwards:

- **25% of the total marks** will be dedicated to assessing a student's ability to apply knowledge and think critically.
- Schools will be provided with **'Competency Focused' question booklets** to guide teachers in the process of framing more effective and relevant assessments.

**Implication for Educators:**

This shift has significant implications for educators. It is no longer sufficient to simply test a student's ability to recall facts. Instead, educators must now focus on:

- Framing questions that challenge students to think critically and analytically.
- Including real-world problem-solving scenarios in their assessments.
- Moving away from a heavy reliance on fact-based recall questions.

### Using Marking Schemes & Topic Weightage for Balanced Question Papers

CISCE provides detailed marking schemes and guidelines on topic weightage to help educators distribute marks effectively across the syllabus. In addition, platforms like **CollegeDekho** and **Jagran Josh** provide valuable analyses of the topic-wise weightage from previous years' papers.

Educators should make use of this data to:

- Proportionally distribute marks based on the importance of each topic.
- Ensure that their assessments are representative of the entire syllabus and provide a balanced evaluation of a student's knowledge and skills.

## The CISCE Biology Curriculum: Grade-wise Learning Objectives

A clear and comprehensive understanding of the CISCE biology syllabus, from Class 6 to 12, is essential for the design of effective and meaningful question papers. The curriculum is structured to ensure a logical progression of biological concepts, allowing students to build a solid foundation of knowledge and develop more advanced skills over time. It is crucial that assessments are closely aligned with the grade-specific topics and the expected depth of learning to ensure that they are both age-appropriate and relevant to the curriculum.

### Middle School (Classes 6-8): Foundational Concepts

- **Class 6:** Plant Life, The Cell, Human Body, Health and Hygiene, Habitat and Adaptation.
- **Class 7:** Plant and Animal Tissues, Kingdom Classification, Photosynthesis, Respiration, Life Processes in Humans (digestion, excretion, nervous system), Allergy.
- **Class 8:** Transport in Plants, Reproduction, Ecosystems, Human Endocrine, Circulatory, and Nervous Systems, Diseases, First Aid, Food Production.

### Secondary and Higher Secondary (Classes 9-12): Advanced Topics

- **Class 9:** Basic Biology (cells, tissues), Flowering Plants, Plant Physiology, Organism Diversity, Human Anatomy and Physiology (nutrition, respiration, skeletal system), Health and Hygiene, Waste Management.
- **Class 10:** Cell Cycle, Genetics, Plant Physiology (transpiration, photosynthesis, plant hormones), Human Anatomy and Physiology (circulatory, excretory, nervous, endocrine, reproductive systems), Population, Human Evolution, Pollution.
- **Class 11:** Diversity of Living Organisms, Structural Organisation in Animals and Plants, Cell Structure and Function, Plant Physiology, Human Physiology.
- **Class 12:** Reproduction, Genetics and Evolution, Biology and Human Welfare, Biotechnology, Ecology, Environment.
