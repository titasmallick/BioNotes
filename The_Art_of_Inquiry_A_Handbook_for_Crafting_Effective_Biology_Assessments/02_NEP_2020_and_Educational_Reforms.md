# NEP 2020 and Educational Reforms

## Alignment with NEP 2020 for Science Assessment

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to transform the Indian education system by shifting the focus of assessments from rote memorization to competency-based evaluation. In the context of biology, this translates to a greater emphasis on conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and the ability to solve real-world problems, rather than simply recalling facts. The policy advocates for assessments that are formative, ongoing, and seamlessly integrated with the learning process, thereby guiding both instruction and student development.

## NEP 2020: A Transformative Vision for Indian Education

NEP 2020 is India's first comprehensive education policy of the 21st century, designed to modernize the sector while preserving the nation's rich cultural ethos. Its primary goal is to create an equitable, high-quality education system that can position India as a global knowledge leader.

Built on the five pillars of **Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability, and Accountability**, NEP 2020 aligns with global education standards such as the **Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4)** and the **Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**. The policy introduces significant structural changes to the education system, enhances alignment with **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, and redefines the very nature of teaching, learning, and assessment.

The adoption of NEP 2020 by major educational boards like **CBSE** and **CISCE** marks a decisive shift towards competency-based learning. The policy’s impact on the education landscape, assessment strategies, and the role of teachers continues to evolve, necessitating a continuous adaptation in teaching methodologies and question design.

## Historical Background and Genesis of NEP 2020

### Evolution of Education Policies in India

India's journey with education policies began with the **1968 National Education Policy**, which aimed to promote literacy and vocational training. This was followed by a revised policy in **1986**, which was subsequently updated in **1992**. These policies introduced key reforms, including the landmark **Right to Education Act (2009)**, which guaranteed free and compulsory schooling for children aged 6-14. NEP 2020 replaces the 1986 policy, heralding a new era in India's education system.

### Need for a New Education Policy

The 1992 policy, while significant in its time, was not equipped to address the challenges of the 21st century. NEP 2020 was formulated to modernize the education system and align it with global goals like **SDG 4**. It places a strong emphasis on quality, innovation, and research, with the aim of equipping students with essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, thereby positioning India as a global knowledge leader.

### Key Committees and Recommendations

The development of the policy began in 2015 with the **T.S.R. Subramanian Committee**, which recommended the establishment of an Indian Education Service, an increase in education funding, and the implementation of compulsory Teacher Entrance Tests. In 2017, the **K. Kasturirangan Committee** was tasked with drafting the National Education Policy. This committee proposed several major reforms, including the **5+3+3+4 school structure**, a focus on foundational literacy, and the promotion of multidisciplinary education. The policy was approved in 2020, and its implementation is currently underway, shaping curriculum frameworks and policy execution.

| Feature | National Policy on Education 1986/92 | National Education Policy 2020 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **School Structure** | 10+2 | 5+3+3+4 (Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, Secondary) |
| **Early Childhood Education** | Not explicitly covered for ages 3-6 | Integral part of the foundational stage, covering ages 3-6 |
| **Medium of Instruction** | Emphasis on regional languages, but English continued to dominate | Mother tongue/local language as medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, preferably until Grade 8 and beyond; promotion of multilingualism |
| **Focus of Education** | Largely rote learning and exam-oriented | Emphasis on conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and holistic development; integration of vocational education from Grade 6 |
| **Higher Education Regulation** | Multiple regulatory bodies (UGC, AICTE, NCTE) | Proposal for a single overarching regulatory body, the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), with separate verticals for regulation, accreditation, funding, and standard setting |
| **Assessment** | Primarily summative, high-stakes board examinations | Shift towards regular, formative, and competency-based assessments; redesigning of board exams to test core competencies; introduction of 360-degree progress cards |
| **Vocational Education** | Largely separate from mainstream education | Integration of vocational education into all school and higher education institutions in a phased manner, starting from Grade 6 |
| **Flexibility in Higher Ed.** | Limited flexibility in degree programs | Flexible undergraduate degrees with multiple entry and exit options and an Academic Bank of Credit for transfer of credits |

## Alignment of NEP 2020 with SDG 4

### Overview of SDG 4 Targets

**Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4)**, a key component of the **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by UNESCO**, aims to ensure inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all, while also promoting lifelong learning opportunities. It emphasizes universal access to primary and secondary education, gender equality, and the provision of education for marginalized groups. Furthermore, it highlights the crucial role of education in fostering sustainable development, driving economic growth, and promoting global citizenship.

### NEP 2020’s Provisions Addressing SDG 4

NEP 2020 is closely aligned with the targets of SDG 4. It seeks to promote universal education with the goal of achieving a **100% Gross Enrollment Ratio by 2030**. The policy prioritizes equity and inclusion through various measures, including support for socio-economically disadvantaged groups, the establishment of a gender inclusion fund, and the creation of special education zones. It also marks a significant shift in the pedagogical approach, moving from rote learning to experiential and critical thinking-based learning. The policy enhances teacher training and professional development and fosters lifelong learning by expanding adult education, skill development, and vocational training from Class 6 onwards. It also leverages technology to ensure greater access to education for all.

### Challenges in Achieving SDG 4 through NEP 2020

Despite its strong alignment with SDG 4, the implementation of NEP 2020 faces several challenges. These include inadequate infrastructure, funding constraints, a shortage of trained teachers, and a significant digital divide, particularly in rural areas. To overcome these hurdles and realize the policy's vision, there is a need for structured implementation, effective collaboration between stakeholders, and substantial financial investment.

## Benchmarking NEP 2020 Against Global and National Standards

### PISA Assessment and Its Focus

The **Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**, conducted by the **OECD**, is a global benchmark that evaluates the skills of 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics, and science. The assessment focuses on the ability to apply knowledge to real-life challenges, rather than simply testing rote learning. PISA assesses a student's proficiency in problem-solving, critical thinking, and cross-disciplinary skills, which aligns closely with the competency-based education model promoted by NEP 2020.

### NEP 2020's Strategies for Improving Learning Outcomes Relevant to PISA

While NEP 2020 does not explicitly focus on PISA, its reforms are in line with the skills tested in the assessment. The policy's emphasis on foundational literacy and numeracy by Grade 3 is a crucial step towards success in PISA. It promotes a holistic curriculum that fosters critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, moving away from the traditional model of rote learning. NEP 2020 also supports experiential learning, including hands-on activities and arts-integrated education, which can enhance understanding and knowledge retention.

The assessment reforms introduced by the policy aim to shift the focus from memorization to competency-based evaluation, thereby testing higher-order skills such as analysis and critical thinking. The establishment of the **National Assessment Centre (PARAKH)** is intended to monitor learning outcomes and encourage school boards to adopt modern assessment methods that are in line with global standards like PISA.

### India's Participation in PISA and Future Implications

India participated in PISA only once, in 2009, with students from Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The performance was poor, with India ranking second to last. Following this, India withdrew from the assessment, citing a "cultural disconnect" with the test. In 2019, the government announced its decision to rejoin PISA for the 2021 cycle, but participation was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was later canceled in 2022. Currently, India is not listed for PISA 2025, which raises doubts about its future involvement.

PISA provides a valuable global benchmark for countries to assess their education systems. While India has traditionally relied on its national examination systems, experts believe that participation in PISA could offer valuable insights into student performance on an international scale. However, concerns about the cultural relevance of the test and the pressure it may place on students remain significant challenges for policymakers.

## AICTE's Role in Implementing NEP 2020

The **All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)** is actively involved in implementing the reforms of NEP 2020. To boost enrollment in technical education, it has removed the intake limits for eligible institutions. It has also allowed accredited institutions to offer technical courses in Indian languages, which supports NEP 2020’s emphasis on regional language education. Vocational courses are being integrated with traditional technical programs to improve the employability of graduates. AICTE is also fostering a culture of innovation through initiatives like **INDOVATION** and **Institution's Innovation Councils (IIC)**. Additionally, it is providing flexible diploma, degree, and postgraduate programs for working professionals, thereby supporting the goal of lifelong learning.

## From Draft to Policy: The Formulation Process of NEP 2020

### Extensive Public Consultation and Stakeholder Engagement

NEP 2020 was developed through an extensive and inclusive consultation process. The process began in January 2015, with the **Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)** gathering over two lakh suggestions from stakeholders across 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats, 6,600 Blocks, 6,000 Urban Local Bodies, and 676 Districts. The **Draft National Education Policy 2019**, prepared by the **Kasturirangan Committee**, was shared on the MHRD's website and the 'MyGov Innovate' portal for public feedback.

Consultations were also held with State Governments, Union Territories, and various Ministries. State Education Secretaries and Members of Parliament were engaged in the process, and a special meeting of the **Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE)** was held with Education Ministers, university heads, and senior officials. This democratic and inclusive process ensured that there was broad participation in the shaping of India's new education policy.

### Role of Committees in Drafting NEP 2020

The development of the policy involved several key committees. The first phase began with the **T. S. R. Subramanian Committee**, which submitted its report in May 2016, laying the foundation for NEP 2020. In June 2017, the **Kasturirangan Committee** was formed, and it submitted the **Draft National Education Policy 2019** in May 2019, which became the basis for the final policy.

To align the curricula with the vision of NEP 2020, the Ministry of Education set up a 12-member committee, also led by **Dr. K. Kasturirangan**, in September 2021. This committee was tasked with designing four **National Curriculum Frameworks (NCFs)** for school education, early childhood care, teacher education, and adult education. Their work is crucial in ensuring that syllabi, textbooks, and teaching methods are all aligned with the transformative vision of NEP 2020.

### Key Stages and Timelines in the NEP 2020 Formulation Process

The development of NEP 2020 spanned several years and involved a series of distinct phases:

- **January 2015:** The consultation process began under the T. S. R. Subramanian Committee.
- **May 2016:** The Subramanian Committee submitted its report.
- **June 2017:** The K. Kasturirangan Committee was formed to draft the policy.
- **May 2019:** The Draft National Education Policy 2019 was submitted, followed by extensive public consultations.
- **March-April 2020:** The Draft Cabinet Note on NEP 2020 was circulated for inter-ministerial consultation.
- **July 29, 2020:** NEP 2020 was approved by the Union Cabinet.
- **September 2021:** A steering committee, once again led by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, was set up to develop new curricula.

### Official Approval and Notification

NEP 2020 was officially approved on **July 29, 2020**. Following the approval, the Ministry of Education distributed copies of the policy to key stakeholders, including government officials, the **University Grants Commission (UGC)**, the **All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)**, and state education departments. These entities were tasked with disseminating the policy and initiating its implementation. This approval marked the transition of NEP 2020 from a draft to a formal policy framework.

## Core Principles and Key Establishments of NEP 2020

NEP 2020 is built on five foundational pillars:

- **Access:** Ensuring that all children have access to quality education, regardless of their socio-economic background.
- **Equity:** Bridging the gaps in education by providing support to marginalized and disadvantaged groups.
- **Quality:** Moving away from a system of rote learning to one that focuses on critical thinking, creativity, and conceptual understanding.
- **Affordability:** Addressing the financial barriers to education through measures such as fee regulation, student loans, and scholarships.
- **Accountability:** Promoting transparency and a sense of responsibility at all levels of the education system.

These pillars form the foundation for the transformative vision of NEP 2020 for education in India.

## Structural Changes in the Education System (5+3+3+4 Framework)

NEP 2020 replaces the traditional 10+2 structure with a new **5+3+3+4 model**, which covers the age group of 3-18 years:

- **Foundational Stage (5 years):** Ages 3-8 (Preschool/Anganwadi + Grades 1-2) → This stage focuses on play-based learning and the development of language skills.
- **Preparatory Stage (3 years):** Ages 8-11 (Grades 3-5) → The emphasis at this stage is on interactive, discovery-based learning and the development of foundational numeracy skills.
- **Middle Stage (3 years):** Ages 11-14 (Grades 6-8) → This stage involves the introduction of abstract concepts in subjects like science, mathematics, social sciences, and humanities.
- **Secondary Stage (4 years):** Ages 14-18 (Grades 9-12) → This stage is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on critical thinking and flexibility in the choice of subjects.

This new structure formally integrates **Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)** into the school system, which is a significant step towards holistic development.

## Holistic and Multidisciplinary Education

NEP 2020 promotes an integrated approach to learning by removing the rigid separations between:

- Arts and sciences
- Curricular and extracurricular activities
- Vocational and academic streams

Students are now encouraged to mix and match disciplines, which ensures a more well-rounded and holistic education.

## Focus on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN)

NEP 2020 prioritizes foundational literacy and numeracy as essential skills for all learners:

- A **National Mission on FLN** is to be launched by the Ministry of Education.
- The goal is to ensure that all children achieve foundational literacy and numeracy by Grade 3 by the year 2025.
- State governments are required to develop implementation plans to achieve the goal of universal primary education.

## Reforming Biology Question Papers: A Shift from Rote Learning to Competency-Based Assessment

NEP 2020 necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of the traditional approach to designing question papers in Biology. It urges educators to:

- Move beyond questions that are solely based on recall.
- Emphasize the assessment of skills such as application, analysis, evaluation, and creation.
- Foster critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, rather than simply rewarding memorization.

This shift is in line with the policy’s vision of promoting deep and meaningful learning, ensuring that students are able to apply biological concepts in practical situations, rather than just reproducing them from memory.

## CISCE’s Adoption of Competency-Based Assessments (From 2025 Onwards)

In recognition of the need for a more concept-based approach to evaluation, the **Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)** has announced a series of key assessment reforms for both **ICSE** and **ISC** examinations, which will be implemented from 2025 onwards:

- **25% of the total marks** will be allocated to merit-based evaluation, with a focus on assessing the application of knowledge and conceptual understanding.
- Schools will be provided with subject-wise **'Competency Focused' question booklets** to guide teachers in the process of framing effective assessments.

## Beyond Written Exams: NEP 2020’s Holistic Assessment Vision

While written examinations will continue to play a crucial role in the assessment process, NEP 2020 also emphasizes the need for a more multi-dimensional approach to assessment. This includes the use of various other methods, such as:

- Group discussions
- Student portfolios
- Project-based learning
- Presentations and practical demonstrations

Biology educators are encouraged to integrate these diverse evaluation methods into their teaching practices to create a more comprehensive and holistic assessment strategy.

## Role of PARAKH: Standardizing National Assessments

To ensure a unified and standardized approach to evaluation across the country, NEP 2020 envisions the establishment of the **National Assessment Centre (PARAKH)**. The key responsibilities of PARAKH will include:

- Setting benchmarks and guidelines for student evaluation.
- Encouraging school boards to align their assessment practices with the principles of competency-based assessment.
- Shaping the future structure of board exams in line with the objectives of NEP 2020.

## Implementation Status and Progress of NEP 2020

### Nationwide Implementation Overview

The implementation of NEP 2020 is a collaborative effort that involves coordination between the Union and State Governments, various education boards, and regulatory bodies. **Karnataka** was the first state to implement the policy in August 2021, and it was soon followed by other states such as **Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana**. Other states, including **Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, and Chhattisgarh**, have initiated phased rollouts of the policy.

At the higher education level, the **University Grants Commission (UGC)** approved the provision of dual degrees in April 2022, which promotes greater flexibility in learning. The Ministry of Education launched the **New Curriculum Framework** for children aged 3-8 and the **National Credit Framework** in October 2022. The **National Digital University** is set to be launched in January 2025. Other key initiatives that have been launched as part of the implementation of NEP 2020 include the **PM SHRI schools**, the **NIPUN Bharat mission** for foundational literacy, and the **Academic Bank of Credit**.

### Implementation by CBSE

The **Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)** is actively integrating vocational skills into its curriculum from Classes 6 to 12 through a combination of regular classes, hobby clubs, and online self-learning modules. The skill subjects are being mapped to the **National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF)** to provide students with clear career pathways. The board has also announced that **Composite Skill Labs** will be established in all its schools by 2026. In a major shift, the state of **Maharashtra** has announced that it will adopt the CBSE curriculum for all its state schools from Class 1 to 12, starting from the 2025-26 academic year, in a move to align with the principles of NEP 2020.

### Implementation by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)

The **Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)**, which oversees the **ICSE** and **ISC** board exams, is also introducing a series of major reforms that are aligned with NEP 2020. From the 2025-26 academic year, **robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)** will be introduced as subjects for Classes XI and XII, and AI and coding will be integrated into the computer science courses for younger students.

A **‘holistic progress card’** will be introduced to provide a 360-degree evaluation of a student's development, covering both academic and non-academic domains. Competency-based exams will be introduced, with **25% competency-based questions in 2025**, which will be increased to **40% in 2026** and **50% in 2027**. Digital assessments for Classes III, V, and VIII will be introduced from the 2025-26 academic year to identify students who may require additional support. CISCE also plans to launch a school improvement initiative, which will encourage high-performing schools to collaborate with state governments to enhance the quality of education in government institutions.

## Criticisms and Challenges of NEP 2020

### Concerns Over Centralization

One of the major criticisms of NEP 2020 is that it has the potential to over-centralize the education system, thereby reducing the autonomy of the states. The emphasis on national standards has raised concerns about a top-down approach that may not be able to fully address the diverse educational needs of different states and regions.

### Funding and Resource Allocation Challenges

One of the most significant challenges in the implementation of NEP 2020 is securing adequate funding. The policy aims to increase public spending on education to **6% of the GDP**, but achieving this target is a difficult task, given the other competing priorities in the national budget. Without sufficient investment, crucial reforms such as teacher training, infrastructure development, and the integration of technology could face serious delays.

### Diversity and Infrastructure Gaps

India’s vast socio-economic and geographical diversity creates significant obstacles to the uniform implementation of NEP 2020. Many rural and remote areas lack basic school infrastructure, including classrooms, laboratories, and access to digital resources. The digital divide, which refers to the unequal access to devices, internet connectivity, and digital literacy, is a major barrier to the implementation of technology-based education reforms. Ensuring equity in the implementation of the policy will require strategic investments and localized solutions.

### Criticism from Educators and Policymakers

#### Concerns About Examinations and Student Pressure

The policy's emphasis on standardized examinations has raised concerns about the potential for increased academic pressure on students. While the provision of multiple board exam attempts may offer some flexibility, it could also lead to heightened competition and stress among students.

#### Vocational Education and Subject Choices

NEP 2020 encourages the integration of vocational education into the mainstream curriculum, but some educators have expressed concerns that early specialization in skill-based training might limit a student's exposure to a diverse range of subjects, which could potentially restrict their intellectual and creative development.

#### Unclear Implementation Strategy

Despite its ambitious goals, critics have argued that NEP 2020 lacks a clear and detailed roadmap for its execution, which has led to an uneven pace of adoption across different states and schools. The policy's promotion of public-private partnerships in education has also raised concerns about the potential for the privatization of schooling, which could make quality education less accessible to marginalized communities.

#### Legal and Systemic Issues

The coexistence of NEP 2020 with the **Right to Education Act, 2009**, creates the potential for legal conflicts in terms of implementation. Additionally, long-standing issues such as teacher absenteeism, ineffective teaching methods, and a mismatch between the skills of graduates and the demands of the job market remain largely unaddressed in the policy.

## Conclusion: The Way Forward

The National Education Policy 2020 represents a paradigm shift in the Indian education landscape. It is a forward-looking policy that aims to create a more holistic, flexible, and learner-centric education system. For biology educators, the NEP 2020 presents both an opportunity and a challenge. The shift towards competency-based assessment requires a move away from traditional methods of teaching and testing, and a greater emphasis on fostering critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

While the implementation of the policy is still in its early stages, it is clear that it has the potential to bring about a significant transformation in the way we teach and learn biology. By embracing the principles of the NEP 2020 and by continuously adapting our teaching and assessment strategies, we can help to create a more engaging, relevant, and meaningful learning experience for our students, and in doing so, we can help to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
