# Practical Guide and Templates

## A Practical Guide for Framing Biology Question Papers (Classes 6-12)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Identify the learning objectives and the total marks for the assessment.**
2.  **Ensure that the paper has a comprehensive coverage of the syllabus and a good balance of the different cognitive levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy.**
3.  **Select the appropriate types of questions (e.g., MCQs, short/long answers, diagrams, case-based).**
4.  **Frame clear, concise, and unambiguous questions, using the correct action verbs.**
5.  **Allocate the marks and the time for each question based on its complexity.**
6.  **Develop a clear and detailed marking scheme.**
7.  **Review and refine the paper through a process of peer evaluation.**
8.  **Reviewing and Refining the Question Paper:** Before finalizing the question paper, it is essential to review it thoroughly. Check for any errors, ambiguities, or inconsistencies. Ensure that the paper is fair, balanced, and aligned with the learning objectives. It is also a good practice to get the paper reviewed by a colleague to get a fresh perspective.

### Grade-Specific Templates

It is a good practice to create adaptable templates for the different classes and the different mark distributions. 

**Example for Class 9 (50 marks):**

*   **Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (10 marks)**
    *   10 questions of 1 mark each, covering a broad range of topics from the syllabus.
    *   Focus on **Remembering** and **Understanding** levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.
*   **Section B: Short Answer Questions (15 marks)**
    *   5 questions of 3 marks each.
    *   Focus on **Understanding** and **Applying** levels.
    *   Example: "Explain the difference between osmosis and diffusion with an example of each."
*   **Section C: Long Answer Questions (15 marks)**
    *   3 questions of 5 marks each.
    *   Focus on **Analyzing** and **Evaluating** levels.
    *   Example: "Describe the structure of the human heart with a well-labeled diagram. Explain the path of blood circulation through the heart."
*   **Section D: Case-Based/Diagram-Based Question (10 marks)**
    *   1 question of 10 marks, with sub-parts.
    *   Focus on **Applying**, **Analyzing**, and **Creating** levels.
    *   Example: A case study on a nutritional disorder, with questions on its causes, symptoms, and prevention. Or a diagram of a food web with questions on the interdependence of organisms.

**Example for Class 11 (70 marks):**

*   **Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (14 marks)**
    *   14 questions of 1 mark each, covering all the units of the syllabus.
    *   Focus on **Remembering** and **Understanding**.
*   **Section B: Short Answer Questions - I (10 marks)**
    *   5 questions of 2 marks each.
    *   Focus on **Understanding** and **Applying**.
*   **Section C: Short Answer Questions - II (15 marks)**
    *   5 questions of 3 marks each.
    *   Focus on **Applying** and **Analyzing**.
*   **Section D: Long Answer Questions (21 marks)**
    *   3 questions of 7 marks each, with internal choice.
    *   Focus on **Analyzing**, **Evaluating**, and **Creating**.
    *   Example: "Explain the mechanism of enzyme action with the help of the lock and key hypothesis. Discuss the factors that affect enzyme activity."
*   **Section E: Case-Based/Diagram-Based Question (10 marks)**
    *   1 question of 10 marks, with sub-parts.
    *   Focus on **Applying**, **Analyzing**, and **Evaluating**.
    *   Example: A pedigree chart of a family with a genetic disorder, with questions on the mode of inheritance and the probability of the offspring being affected.

Similar templates should be created that are in alignment with Bloom’s Taxonomy for all the different grades.

### Integrating NEP 2020 & Bloom’s Taxonomy

- Use competency-based questions that require the students to apply their knowledge of biology to real-world contexts.
- Go beyond the level of simple recall by designing questions that require the students to analyze, evaluate, and create.

**Example:** Instead of asking a question like "Define the term photosynthesis," you could ask a question like "Explain how the process of photosynthesis contributes to the carbon cycle."

- Align the questions with the higher-order skills to ensure a deep and conceptual understanding of the subject.

This structured approach can help to ensure that the assessments are balanced, fair, and effective.
