# ICSE Biology Exam Analysis & Prediction

---

## Key Findings and General Patterns

*   **Core Topics are Evergreen:** Circulatory System, Nervous System, Photosynthesis, Genetics are consistently high-yield.
*   **Diagrams are Crucial:** Expect diagrams of Neuron, Nephron, Human Heart, Mitosis stages, Human Eye, Chloroplast, and experimental setups.
*   **Shift Towards Application & Analysis:** Recent papers show a clear trend from simple recall to application, analysis, and Assertion-Reason questions.
*   **"Logical Sequence" and "Odd One Out" are Staples:** Common question formats in Section A.
*   **Full Forms and Technical Terms:** Essential for easy marks.

## How to Predict and Prepare

1.  **Master "Very High" Confidence Topics:** Focus on Circulatory System, Nervous System, Plant Physiology (Photosynthesis & Transpiration), and Genetics.
2.  **Practice All Key Diagrams:** Practice drawing and labeling from memory.
3.  **Focus on Differentiations and "Give Reasons":** Create comparison tables (e.g., Artery vs. Vein, Mitosis vs. Meiosis).
4.  **Study the Latest Specimen Paper Intensely:** Most accurate guide for format and style.
5.  **Memorize Definitions and Sequences:** Use flashcards for key terms and logical sequences.
