## Types of Diseases

Diseases can be broadly categorized into:

*   **Communicable Diseases:** Diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another, or from animals to humans. They are caused by pathogens (germs) like bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and worms.
    *   **Bacterial Diseases:** Caused by bacteria (e.g., Tuberculosis, Typhoid, Cholera).
    *   **Viral Diseases:** Caused by viruses (e.g., Common Cold, Flu, Measles, Chickenpox).
    *   **Protozoal Diseases:** Caused by protozoa (e.g., Malaria, Amoebic Dysentery).
    *   **Diseases Caused by Worms:** Caused by parasitic worms (e.g., Ascariasis, Filariasis).

## Modes of Transmission of Diseases

Communicable diseases can spread through various ways:

*   **Direct Contact:** Touching an infected person, kissing, sexual contact.
*   **Indirect Contact:** Touching contaminated objects (doorknobs, toys, clothes).
*   **Droplet Transmission:** Through coughs or sneezes (e.g., cold, flu).
*   **Airborne Transmission:** Pathogens remain suspended in the air for longer periods (e.g., Tuberculosis).
*   **Vector-borne Transmission:** Transmitted by living organisms (vectors) like mosquitoes (Malaria, Dengue), flies (Typhoid), or ticks.
*   **Water-borne Transmission:** Through contaminated water (e.g., Cholera, Typhoid).
*   **Food-borne Transmission:** Through contaminated food (e.g., Food poisoning).

## Ways to Prevent Communicable Diseases

*   **Personal Hygiene:** Regular hand washing, bathing, brushing teeth.
*   **Public Hygiene:** Proper disposal of waste, sanitation, clean drinking water supply.
*   **Vaccination:** Immunization against specific diseases.
*   **Isolation:** Separating infected individuals to prevent spread.
*   **Vector Control:** Controlling populations of disease-carrying vectors (e.g., mosquito control).
*   **Safe Food and Water:** Ensuring food is cooked properly and water is clean.
*   **Healthy Lifestyle:** Balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate rest to boost immunity.

## Hygiene

**Hygiene:** Practices conducive to maintaining health and preventing disease, especially through cleanliness.

### Examples of Hygiene Practices

*   Washing hands with soap and water before eating and after using the toilet.
*   Bathing daily.
*   Brushing teeth twice a day.
*   Keeping nails short and clean.
*   Covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

### Ways to Keep the Surroundings Clean

*   **Safe Disposal of Garbage:** Proper segregation of waste (biodegradable and non-biodegradable) and disposing of it in designated bins.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Sweeping, mopping, and dusting homes and public places regularly.
*   **Drainage Systems:** Ensuring proper functioning of drainage and sewage systems to prevent water stagnation.
*   **Pest Control:** Controlling pests like mosquitoes, flies, and rodents.
*   **Clean Public Spaces:** Avoiding littering in public areas.

### Healthy Practices for Hygiene

*   Using clean utensils for cooking and eating.
*   Storing food properly to prevent contamination.
*   Drinking boiled or filtered water.
*   Avoiding open defecation.
*   Maintaining cleanliness in schools and workplaces.
