# Adaptation

## Habitat

*   **Definition:** The natural home or environment of an animal, plant, or other organism.

---

## Adaptations of Plants and Animals to Different Habitats

*   Organisms develop special features or behaviors to survive and thrive in their specific habitats.

---

### Aquatic Habitat

*   **Adaptations in Plants:**
    *   **Floating Plants:** Light, spongy bodies, air-filled cavities (e.g., Water Hyacinth).
    *   **Submerged Plants:** Thin, flexible stems, narrow/finely dissected leaves, no stomata (e.g., Hydrilla).
    *   **Fixed Plants:** Roots fixed in mud, long hollow stems, large flat leaves with stomata on upper side (e.g., Water Lily).
*   **Adaptations in Fish:**
    *   **Streamlined Body:** Reduces friction.
    *   **Fins:** For balance, steering, propulsion.
    *   **Gills:** For underwater breathing.
    *   **Scales:** Protection, reduce friction.
    *   **Swim Bladder:** Maintains buoyancy.

### Desert Habitat

*   **Adaptations in Cactus (Desert Plant):**
    *   **Spines:** Modified leaves to reduce water loss, protect.
    *   **Fleshy Stem:** Stores water, performs photosynthesis.
    *   **Waxy Coating:** Prevents water loss.
    *   **Deep Roots:** Absorb water from large area.
*   **Adaptations in Camel (Desert Animal):**
    *   **Hump:** Stores fat (metabolized for water/energy).
    *   **Long Legs:** Keep body away from hot sand.
    *   **Broad, Flat Feet:** Prevent sinking in sand.
    *   **Long Eyelashes/Closable Nostrils:** Protect from sandstorms.
    *   **Ability to Drink Large Amounts of Water.**
    *   **Tolerates High Body Temperature:** Reduces sweating.

---

### Mountain Habitat

*   **Adaptations in Trees (Pine, Fir):**
    *   **Conical Shape:** Snow slides off easily.
    *   **Needle-like Leaves:** Reduce water loss, prevent snow accumulation.
    *   **Thick, Waxy Coating:** Protection against cold, reduces water loss.
*   **Adaptations in Mountain Goat:**
    *   **Strong Hooves:** Excellent grip on rocky slopes.
    *   **Thick Fur:** Insulation against cold.
    *   **Agile and Sure-footed:** Navigates treacherous terrain.

---

### Air Habitat

*   **Adaptations for Flight in Birds:**
    *   **Streamlined Body:** Reduces air resistance.
    *   **Hollow Bones:** Lightens body.
    *   **Wings:** Modified forelimbs, provide lift/propulsion.
    *   **Strong Flight Muscles:** Power wings.
    *   **Feathers:** Insulation, aid flight, shape body.
*   **Aerial Plants (e.g., Orchids, Money Plant):**
    *   **Adaptations:** Develop aerial roots to absorb moisture from air or attach for support. Do not grow in soil.
