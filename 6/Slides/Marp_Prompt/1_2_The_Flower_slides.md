# The Flower

## Parts of a Flower (4 Whorls)

*   Typical bisexual flower has four concentric whorls on the receptacle.
1.  **Calyx (Sepals):** Outermost, green, protects bud.
2.  **Corolla (Petals):** Inside calyx, brightly colored, attracts pollinators.
3.  **Androecium (Stamens):** Male reproductive part (anther, filament), produces pollen.
4.  **Gynoecium (Pistil/Carpel):** Female reproductive part (stigma, style, ovary), contains ovules.

---

## Pollination

*   Transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma.
*   **Self-Pollination:** Pollen transfer within same flower or same plant.
*   **Cross-Pollination:** Pollen transfer between flowers on different plants of the same species.

---

### Agents of Cross-Pollination

1.  **Wind (Anemophily):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Small, inconspicuous, dull-colored, no scent/nectar. Large amounts of light, dry pollen. Large, feathery stigmas.
    *   **Examples:** Grasses, Maize.
2.  **Water (Hydrophily):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Small, inconspicuous, often submerged. Light, unwettable pollen.
    *   **Examples:** Vallisneria, Hydrilla.
3.  **Insects (Entomophily):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Large, brightly colored, fragrant, produce nectar. Sticky/spiny pollen. Sticky stigmas.
    *   **Examples:** Rose, Sunflower, Hibiscus.

---

## Fertilization

*   Fusion of male gamete (from pollen) with female gamete (in ovule) to form a zygote.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Pollen grain lands on stigma.
    2.  Pollen grain germinates, grows pollen tube down style to ovary.
    3.  Male gametes travel down pollen tube to ovule.
    4.  One male gamete fuses with egg cell inside ovule, forming zygote.

---

## Formation of Fruit

*   After fertilization, flower parts wither and fall off.
*   **Ovary:** Develops into the **fruit**.
*   **Ovules:** Develop into the **seeds**.

---

## Parts of Fruits

*   Protect seeds and aid in dispersal.
*   **Dry Fruits:** Pericarp (fruit wall) is dry at maturity (e.g., Pea pod, Rice).
*   **Fleshy Fruits:** Pericarp is fleshy and juicy at maturity (e.g., Mango, Apple).

---

### Parts of the Pericarp of Fleshy Fruits

1.  **Epicarp:** Outermost layer (skin/peel), provides protection.
2.  **Mesocarp:** Middle, fleshy, often edible part. Stores food and water.
3.  **Endocarp:** Innermost layer, hard/stony or membranous. Encloses and protects seed(s).

---

## Seed

*   Fertilized ovule.
*   Contains an embryo and stored food.
*   Enclosed within a protective seed coat.

---

### Parts of a Seed

*   **Seed Coat:** Outer protective layer.
*   **Embryo:** Miniature plant within seed.
    *   **Radicle:** The embryonic root.
    *   **Plumule:** The embryonic shoot (stem and leaves).
*   **Cotyledon(s):** Seed leaves, store food or transfer food from endosperm.

---

### Types of Seeds

*   **Monocotyledonous (Monocot) Seed:** Contains a single cotyledon.
    *   **Examples:** Maize, Rice, Wheat.
*   **Dicotyledonous (Dicot) Seed:** Contains two cotyledons.
    *   **Examples:** Bean, Pea, Gram.

---

## Germination

*   Process by which a seed sprouts and grows into a new plant.

---

### Conditions Required for Germination

1.  **Moisture (Water):** Softens seed coat, activates enzymes.
2.  **Warmth (Suitable Temperature):** Optimal temperature for enzyme function.
3.  **Air (Oxygen):** Required for embryo respiration to release energy.

---

### Seed Germination of Different Seeds

*   **Bean Seed (Dicot - Epigeal Germination):** Cotyledons pushed above soil by hypocotyl elongation.
*   **Maize Seed (Monocot - Hypogeal Germination):** Cotyledon remains below soil, plumule emerges above ground.
