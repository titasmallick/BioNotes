# Health and Hygiene

## Types of Diseases

*   **Communicable Diseases:** Diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another, or from animals to humans. They are caused by pathogens (germs) like bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and worms.
    *   **Bacterial Diseases:** Caused by bacteria (e.g., Tuberculosis, Typhoid, Cholera).
    *   **Viral Diseases:** Caused by viruses (e.g., Common Cold, Flu, Measles, Chickenpox).
    *   **Protozoal Diseases:** Caused by protozoa (e.g., Malaria, Amoebic Dysentery).
    *   **Diseases Caused by Worms:** Caused by parasitic worms (e.g., Ascariasis, Filariasis).

## Modes of Transmission of Diseases

*   **Direct Contact:** Touching an infected person, kissing, sexual contact.
*   **Indirect Contact:** Touching contaminated objects (doorknobs, toys, clothes).
*   **Droplet Transmission:** Through coughs or sneezes (e.g., cold, flu).
*   **Airborne Transmission:** Pathogens remain suspended in the air for longer periods (e.g., Tuberculosis).
*   **Vector-borne Transmission:** Transmitted by living organisms (vectors) like mosquitoes (Malaria, Dengue), flies (Typhoid), or ticks.
*   **Water-borne Transmission:** Through contaminated water (e.g., Cholera, Typhoid).
*   **Food-borne Transmission:** Through contaminated food (e.g., Food poisoning).
