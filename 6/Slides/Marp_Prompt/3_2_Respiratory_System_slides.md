# Respiratory System

## Main Parts and Functions

*   Responsible for exchange of gases (O₂ and CO₂) between body and environment.
1.  **Nose:** Filters, warms, moistens inhaled air. Contains olfactory receptors for smell.
2.  **Pharynx (Throat):** Common passageway for air and food.
3.  **Larynx (Voice Box):** Contains vocal cords, produces sound.
4.  **Trachea (Windpipe):** Carries air from larynx to bronchi, supported by C-shaped cartilaginous rings.
5.  **Bronchi:** Trachea divides into two main bronchi, one leading to each lung. They further branch into smaller bronchioles, carrying air into the lungs.
6.  **Lungs:** Primary organs of respiration, gas exchange occurs in tiny air sacs called alveoli.

## Difference between Respiration and Breathing

| Feature | Respiration | Breathing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | Biochemical (cellular level) | Physical (mechanical) |
| **Energy** | Releases energy from food | Involves intake and expulsion of air |
| **Location** | Inside cells (mitochondria) | Lungs and respiratory passages |
| **Enzymes** | Involves many enzymes | No enzymes involved |

## Mechanism of Breathing

*   Physical process involving two main phases: inhalation and exhalation.
*   **Inhalation (Breathing In):**
    *   Diaphragm contracts and moves downwards.
    *   Ribs move upwards and outwards (intercostal muscles contract).
    *   Increases chest cavity volume, reducing pressure inside lungs. Air rushes in.
*   **Exhalation (Breathing Out):**
    *   Diaphragm relaxes and moves upwards.
    *   Ribs move downwards and inwards (intercostal muscles relax).
    *   Decreases chest cavity volume, increasing pressure inside lungs. Air is forced out.

## Common Respiratory Diseases

*   **Asthma:** Chronic inflammatory disease of airways, causes difficulty breathing, wheezing.
*   **Bronchitis:** Inflammation of bronchial tubes, causing cough with mucus.
*   **Pneumonia:** Infection inflaming air sacs, may fill with fluid/pus, causing cough, fever, difficulty breathing.
*   **Tuberculosis (T.B.):** Serious infectious bacterial disease, mainly affects lungs.
