# The Leaf

## External Structure of a Leaf

*   **Petiole:** Stalk attaching leaf blade to stem.
*   **Leaf Blade (Lamina):** Broad, flat part, photosynthesis.
*   **Midrib:** Central vein.
*   **Veins:** Vascular tissues (xylem, phloem).
*   **Apex:** Leaf tip.
*   **Margin:** Leaf edge.
*   **Base:** Part of blade attached to petiole.

## Kinds of Leaves

*   **Simple Leaf:** Single, undivided leaf blade (e.g., Mango, Guava).
*   **Compound Leaf:** Leaf blade divided into several smaller leaflets (e.g., Neem, Rose).

---

## Types of Venation

*   Pattern of veins in leaf blade.
*   **Reticulate Venation:** Veins form a net-like pattern (e.g., most dicots like Peepal).
*   **Parallel Venation:** Veins run parallel to each other (e.g., most monocots like Grass, Maize).

## Functions of a Leaf

1.  **Photosynthesis:** Primary function, produces food.
2.  **Transpiration:** Water vapor loss, cools plant, pulls water up.
3.  **Respiration:** Takes in O₂, releases CO₂, releases energy.
4.  **Storage:** Some leaves store food or water (e.g., Onion, Aloe Vera).

## Modifications of Leaves

*   **Tendrils:** For climbing (e.g., Pea).
*   **Spines:** For protection and reducing water loss (e.g., Cactus).
*   **Storage Leaves:** Fleshy, store food/water (e.g., Onion).
*   **Phyllodes:** Flattened petioles functioning as leaves (e.g., Australian Acacia).

## Insectivorous Plants

*   Derive nutrients (not energy) from trapping/consuming insects.
*   Grow in nutrient-poor soils (nitrogen deficient).
*   **Need for Modification:** To supplement nitrogen intake.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Pitcher Plant:** Leaves modified into pitcher-like traps.
    *   **Venus Flytrap:** Leaves form snapping traps.

## Vegetative Propagation in Leaf

*   Some plants reproduce asexually from leaves.
*   **Example:** **Bryophyllum (Mother of Thousands):** Adventitious buds develop on leaf margins, grow into new plantlets.
