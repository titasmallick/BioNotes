# The Cell

## Plant Cell: Cell Organelles and their Functions

*   Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that differ from animal cells in several key aspects, primarily due to the presence of a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole.
*   **Cell Wall:** Rigid outer layer (cellulose). Provides structural support, protection, maintains shape, prevents excessive water uptake.
*   **Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane):** Thin, semi-permeable lipid bilayer. Controls substance movement.
*   **Plastids:** Membrane-bound organelles.
    *   **Chloroplasts:** Sites of photosynthesis.
    *   Other plastids: Pigment synthesis, food storage.
*   **Nucleus:** Large, spherical/oval, contains DNA (chromosomes). Controls cell activities (growth, metabolism, reproduction).
*   **Vacuole:** Large, central (up to 90% cell volume), tonoplast membrane. Stores water, nutrients, waste, maintains turgor pressure.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Jelly-like substance filling cell, surrounds organelles. Site of metabolic reactions, organelle movement.

## Animal Cell: Cell Organelles and their Functions

*   Animal cells are eukaryotic cells that lack a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, which are characteristic of plant cells.
*   **Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane):** Thin, flexible, outer boundary (lipid bilayer). Controls substance passage, cell communication.
*   **Plastids:** Absent (no photosynthesis).
*   **Nucleus:** Large, spherical/oval, contains DNA (chromosomes). Controls cellular activities.
*   **Vacuole:** Several small, temporary vacuoles (if any). Involved in temporary storage/transport.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Jelly-like substance filling cell, surrounds organelles. Site of metabolic reactions, organelle movement.

## Differences between Plant and Animal Cells

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell Wall** | Present (rigid, cellulose) | Absent |
| **Cell Membrane** | Present (inside cell wall) | Present (outer boundary) |
| **Plastids** | Present (e.g., chloroplasts) | Absent |
| **Nucleus** | Present (often pushed to periphery) | Present (usually central) |
| **Vacuole** | One large, central vacuole | Several small, temporary vacuoles (if any) |
| **Cytoplasm** | Present | Present |
