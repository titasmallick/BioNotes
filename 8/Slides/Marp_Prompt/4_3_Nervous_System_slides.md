# Nervous System

---

## Divisions of the Nervous System

*   **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Primary control center.
    *   **Brain:** Control center, intelligence, learning, memory, emotions.
    *   **Spinal Cord:** Relays info to/from brain, mediates reflex actions.
*   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Network of nerves extending from CNS to all other parts of the body. Relays info to/from CNS.
    *   **Somatic Nervous System:** Controls voluntary movements, relays sensory info.
    *   **Autonomic Nervous System:** Regulates involuntary functions (heart rate, digestion).
        *   **Sympathetic:** "Fight or flight."
        *   **Parasympathetic:** "Rest and digest."

## Cells of the Nervous System

*   **Neurons:** Primary functional units. Specialized cells transmitting electrical and chemical signals.
    *   Consists of cell body, dendrites (receive signals), axon (sends signals).
*   **Glial Cells (Glia):** Supporting cells. Provide physical and metabolic support.

## Types of Nerves

*   **Sensory Nerves:** Carry signals from sense organs to brain.
*   **Motor Nerves:** Carry signals from brain to muscles and glands.
*   **Mixed Nerves:** Contain both sensory and motor fibers.

---

## Cranial and Spinal Nerves

*   **Cranial Nerves:** Emerge directly from the brain.
    *   **Number:** 12 pairs.
*   **Spinal Nerves:** Emerge from the spinal cord.
    *   **Number:** 31 pairs.

## Structure of a Motor Neuron

*   **Cell Body:** Main part, contains nucleus.
*   **Dendrites:** Branch-like extensions, receive signals.
*   **Axon:** Long, slender projection, carries signals away.

---

## Reflex Action

*   **Definition:** Involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus.
*   Protective mechanism.
*   **Basic Terms:**
    *   **Stimulus:** Evokes a reaction.
    *   **Response:** Reaction to a stimulus.
    *   **Impulse:** Signal transmitted along nerve fiber.
    *   **Receptor:** Organ/cell responding to stimulus.
    *   **Effector:** Organ/cell acting in response to stimulus.
*   **Common Examples:** Withdrawing hand from hot object, blinking.
