# Food Production

---

## Horticulture

*   Branch of agriculture focusing on intensive cultivation of plants.
*   Used for food, medicinal purposes, and aesthetic gratification.
*   Includes fruits, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, ornamental plants.
*   Emphasizes scientific methods, breeding, technical cultivation (smaller scale).
*   **Vegetables:** Edible parts of plants.
*   **Fruits:** Sweet, fleshy product of a plant containing seed.
*   **Decorative Plants and Flowers:** Grown for aesthetic appeal.

## Organic Farming and Green Revolution

### Organic Farming

*   Production system avoiding synthetic inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators).
*   Relies on natural processes: crop rotations, residues, manure, biological pest control.
*   **Aim:** Maintain soil productivity/health, supply nutrients, control pests naturally.
*   **Key Principles:** Natural processes, biodiversity, sustainability, avoiding synthetic chemicals.

### Green Revolution

*   Period (mid-20th century) of significant increases in global crop yields.
*   Achieved through:
    *   High-yielding varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice.
    *   Increased use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides.
    *   Advanced irrigation techniques.
*   **Goal:** Boost agricultural production to combat hunger.
*   **Impact:** Increased food production, but concerns about environmental impact (degradation, biodiversity loss) due to reliance on chemicals.

### Relationship between the Concepts

*   **Horticulture:** Specific domain within agriculture.
*   **Organic Farming:** Practical approach to agriculture, applicable to horticulture, avoids synthetic chemicals.
*   **Green Revolution:** Historical period/practices, largely diverges from organic farming (heavy reliance on synthetic inputs, monoculture).
