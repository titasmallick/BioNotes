# Transport of Food and Minerals in Plants

*   Plants move water, minerals, and food using xylem and phloem.

---

## Transport of Water and Minerals (Xylem)

*   Xylem transports water and dissolved minerals from roots upwards.
*   Primarily unidirectional.

---

### Key Mechanisms

*   **Diffusion:** Movement of substances over short distances (passive).
*   **Osmosis:** Primary way roots absorb water from soil (through semipermeable membrane).
    *   **Semipermeable Membrane:** Allows certain molecules to pass.
    *   **Root Pressure:** Osmotic pressure in root cells causes sap to rise.
*   **Active Transport:** Movement of ions against concentration gradient, requires energy (for mineral uptake).
*   **Transpiration Pull:** Main driving force. Water evaporation from leaves creates tension, pulling water up. Cohesion and adhesion of water molecules maintain column.

---

### Pathway (Water and Minerals)

1.  **Absorption:** Roots absorb water and minerals from soil (root hairs increase surface area).
2.  **Movement to Xylem:** Water and minerals move through root tissues (epidermis, cortex, endodermis) to reach xylem.
3.  **Upward Movement:** Transported upwards through xylem vessels.

## Transport of Food (Phloem)

*   Phloem transports soluble organic compounds (sugars) from leaves to other parts.
*   Process called **translocation**.

---

### Key Features (Phloem)

*   **Source and Sink:** Leaves are "source" (photosynthesis). Roots, fruits, growing tips are "sinks" (require energy).
*   **Mechanism (Pressure-Flow Hypothesis):**
    1.  Sugars loaded into phloem at source, drawing water from xylem by osmosis.
    2.  Creates high pressure at source.
    3.  Sugars unloaded at sink, water moves out, reducing pressure.
    4.  Pressure gradient drives bulk flow from source to sink.
*   **Bidirectional Flow:** Flow in phloem can be in both directions, depending on source/sink location.
*   **Composition:** Phloem sap is water-based, rich in sugars, also transports amino acids, hormones, etc.
