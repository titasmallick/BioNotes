### Uses of Bacteria in Food Industry

*   **Dairy Products:** Lactic acid bacteria (*Lactobacillus*) for yogurt, cheese, kefir, sour cream. Convert lactose to lactic acid.
*   **Fermented Foods:** Pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, salami.
*   **Vinegar:** Acetic acid fermentation from alcohol.
*   **Bread Making:** Lactic acid bacteria contribute to sourdough (flavor, texture, shelf life).
*   **Beverages:** Some alcoholic and non-alcoholic fermented drinks (e.g., kombucha).
*   **Flavor Development:** Produce compounds altering food flavor (e.g., cheeses, sourdough).
*   **Preservation:** Acids produced inhibit spoilage and harmful microorganisms.
*   **Nutritional Enhancement:** Increase nutrient bioavailability, promote beneficial probiotics.
*   **Vitamin Synthesis:** Certain bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*, *Pseudomonas*) synthesize vitamins like B12.
