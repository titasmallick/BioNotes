# Food Production

---

## Fungi

*   Significant and diverse roles in food industry.
*   Contribute to production, preservation, nutritional value, and flavor.

### Importance of Mushrooms in Food Industry

*   **Food Source & Culinary Delicacy:** Edible mushrooms (e.g., button mushrooms) are consumed for unique "umami" flavor and versatile textures.
*   **Nutritional Value:** Rich in protein, fiber, vitamins (B, D, E), minerals (calcium, iron, zinc), antioxidants. Low in calories/fat.
*   **Meat Alternatives:** Used as substitutes in plant-based products due to meaty texture and umami.
*   **Food Value Enhancement:** Extracts/powders added to products to improve nutrition/sensory profiles.
*   **Functional Foods:** Contain bioactive compounds for immune support, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activity.

### Importance of Yeast in Food Industry

*   Yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) is crucial for its fermentation capabilities.
*   **Baking:** Leavening agent in bread (produces CO₂ gas, causes dough to rise).
*   **Brewing:** Essential for alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, spirits) by fermenting sugars into alcohol and CO₂.
*   **Fermented Foods:** Used in other fermented foods for unique flavors, textures, preservation.
*   **Flavor Enhancement:** Yeast extracts used as flavoring agents, mask sour/bitter tastes.
*   **Nutritional Value:** Source of protein, enzymes, vitamins (e.g., nutritional yeast).
