# Circulatory System

*   Vital network transporting nutrients, oxygen, hormones, etc.
*   Removes waste products (e.g., carbon dioxide).
*   Composed of heart, blood vessels, and blood.

---

## Internal Structure of the Heart

*   Muscular organ, pumps blood.
*   Four chambers (two atria, two ventricles).
*   Right side: Deoxygenated blood.
*   Left side: Oxygenated blood.
*   **Valves:** Flaps of tissue that prevent backflow (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, aortic).
*   **Septum:** Muscle wall separating heart sides.
*   **Pacemaker (SA node):** Controls heart rate.

## Schematic Diagram of the Heart

[A simple diagram showing the four chambers (right and left atria, right and left ventricles), valves, and major blood vessels (aorta, pulmonary trunk, vena cava, pulmonary veins)]

## Blood Vessels

*   Complex network for blood transport.
*   **Arteries:** Thick-walled, carry oxygenated blood *away* from heart.
    *   **Aorta:** Largest artery.
    *   **Pulmonary Trunk:** Carries deoxygenated blood to lungs.
    *   **Coronary Artery:** Supplies heart muscle.
*   **Veins:** Carry deoxygenated blood *back* to heart.
    *   **Coronary Vein:** Drains heart muscle.
    *   **Vena Cava:** Largest vein.
*   **Capillaries:** Tiny vessels, connect arteries/veins, exchange gases/nutrients/waste.

---

## Circulation of Blood

*   **Double Circulation:** Blood travels twice through heart per body circuit.
    *   **Pulmonary Circulation:** Heart → lungs (oxygenation) → heart.
    *   **Systemic Circulation:** Heart → rest of body (oxygen delivery) → heart.

---

## Blood

*   Fluid with red/white blood cells, plasma, platelets.
*   Carries oxygen, nutrients, waste.

---

## Blood Groups

*   Determined by antigens on RBC surface.
*   **A, B, AB, and O:** Four main blood groups.
*   **Universal Donor:** Group O.
*   **Universal Acceptor:** Group AB.

---

## Conditions Related to the Functioning of the Heart

*   **Palpitations:** Rapid, strong, irregular heartbeat.
*   **Cardiac Arrest:** Sudden loss of heart function, breathing, consciousness.
*   **Hypertension:** High blood pressure.
*   **Atherosclerosis:** Hardening of arteries due to plaque.
*   **Heart Attack:** Blood flow to heart blocked.
*   **Stroke:** Blood flow to brain interrupted.
*   **Heart Failure:** Heart can't pump effectively.
*   **Arrhythmia:** Irregular heartbeat.

---

## Lymphatic System

*   Network of tissues and organs.
*   Rids body of toxins, waste.
*   Part of circulatory and immune systems.
