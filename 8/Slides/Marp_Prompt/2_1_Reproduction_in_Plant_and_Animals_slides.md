# Reproduction in Plant and Animals

*   Biological process producing new individual organisms (offspring).
*   Fundamental feature of all known life.
*   Two forms: asexual and sexual.

---

## Plants

### Asexual Reproduction

*   Single parent, offspring genetically identical to parent.
*   Common in stable environments.
*   **Binary Fission:** Parent cell splits into two (e.g., Bacteria).
*   **Budding:** New individual develops from parent (e.g., Yeast, Potatoes).
*   **Fragmentation:** Organism splits into fragments, each grows into new individual (e.g., Spirogyra).
*   **Spore Formation:** Organism produces spores (e.g., Fungi, Ferns).
*   **Vegetative Propagation:** New plants from vegetative parts (roots, stems, leaves) (e.g., Potato, Strawberry).
*   **Artificial Propagation by Tissue Culture:** Small tissue grown in lab (e.g., Orchids).
*   **Apomixis:** Seeds produced without fertilization (e.g., Dandelions).

---

### Sexual Reproduction (Plants)

*   Fusion of male and female gametes (sperm and egg) to form zygote.
*   Offspring with unique genetic makeup.
*   Occurs in the flower.

---

#### Parts of a Typical Flower

*   **Calyx:** Outermost whorl, sepals, protect bud.
*   **Corolla:** Whorl inside calyx, petals, attract pollinators.
*   **Androecium:** Male reproductive organ, stamens, produce pollen.
*   **Gynoecium:** Female reproductive organ, carpels/pistil, contains ovules (egg).

---

#### Pollination

*   Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma.
*   **Self-Pollination:** Pollen transfer within same flower or same plant.
*   **Cross-Pollination:** Pollen transfer between different plants of same species.

---

#### Agents of Pollination

*   **Insects:** Large, brightly colored, sweet-scented flowers.
*   **Water:** Small, inconspicuous flowers.
*   **Wind:** Small, inconspicuous, no scent flowers.

---

#### Fertilization (Plants)

*   Pollen grain lands on stigma.
*   Pollen tube grows down to ovule.
*   Male gamete travels down the pollen tube to the ovule and fuses with the female gamete to form a zygote.
*   The zygote develops into an embryo, which is contained within a seed. The ovary of the flower develops into a fruit that protects the seed.
*   **Artificial Pollination:** Manual transfer of pollen.

## Animals

### Asexual Reproduction (Animals)

*   More common in invertebrates.
*   **Fission:** Parent splits into two or more individuals (e.g., Sea anemones).
*   **Budding:** New individual grows out from the parent's body (e.g., Hydras).
*   **Fragmentation:** The parent's body breaks into several pieces, and each piece can grow into a new adult (e.g., Planarians).
*   **Parthenogenesis:** An egg develops into an individual without being fertilized (e.g., Some insects, reptiles).

---

### Sexual Reproduction in Humans

*   Fusion of male and female gametes (sperm and egg) to form zygote.
*   Offspring with unique genetic makeup.

---

#### Male Reproductive System

*   **Testes:** Produce sperm and testosterone.
*   **Scrotum:** Holds testes.
*   **Epididymis:** Stores mature sperm.
*   **Vas Deferens:** Carries sperm to urethra.
*   **Urethra:** Carries urine and semen.
*   **Penis:** The male organ of copulation.

---

#### Female Reproductive System

*   **Ovaries:** Produce eggs and estrogen.
*   **Fallopian Tubes:** Carry eggs to uterus.
*   **Uterus:** Fertilized egg implants and develops.
*   **Cervix:** The lower part of the uterus.
*   **Vagina:** Connects cervix to outside, receives sperm.

---

#### Fertilization (Animals)

*   Fusion of sperm and egg.
*   **External Fertilization:** Gametes released into environment (e.g., Fish, Starfish).
*   **Internal Fertilization:** Male deposits sperm directly into female (e.g., Humans, terrestrial animals).

---

#### Development (Animals)

*   After fertilization, zygote develops into embryo.
*   **Oviparity:** Embryo develops inside egg laid outside body.
*   **Viviparity:** Embryo develops inside female's body, nourished by her.
