# Ecosystems

*   Community of living organisms (biotic) interacting with non-living (abiotic) environment.
*   Energy and nutrients are transferred.
*   Term coined by A.G. Tansley (1935).

## Understanding Ecosystems

*   **Definition:** Biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.
*   **Interaction between Biotic and Abiotic Factors:** Create a stable system. Energy flows, nutrients cycle.

---

## Biotic Components

*   Living parts of an ecosystem.
*   **Producers (autotrophs):** Produce own food (e.g., plants via photosynthesis).
*   **Consumers (heterotrophs):** Obtain food by eating others (primary, secondary, tertiary).
*   **Decomposers (saprotrophs):** Break down dead organic matter (bacteria, fungi).

## Food Chain, Food Web, and Pyramid of Numbers

*   **Food Chain:** Series of organisms where each is food for the next. Energy flows.
*   **Food Web:** Interconnected food chains, showing complex feeding relationships.
*   **Pyramid of Numbers:** Graphical representation of number of organisms at each trophic level. Numbers decrease up the food chain.

---

## Interdependence between Organisms

*   **Symbiosis:** Close, long-term interaction between two species.
*   **Parasitism:** One organism (parasite) benefits at expense of other (host).
*   **Predation:** One organism (predator) kills and eats another (prey).

---

## Abiotic Components

*   Non-living chemical and physical parts of an ecosystem.
*   **Air:** Mixture of gases.
*   **Soil:** Provides nutrients and support.
*   **Water:** Essential for life.
*   **Climatic Factors:**
    *   **Sunlight:** Primary energy source.
    *   **Temperature:** Affects metabolic rates.
    *   **Humidity:** Water vapor in air.
    *   **Wind:** Air movement.

---

## Types of Ecosystems

*   **Terrestrial Ecosystems:** Land-based.
    *   **Forest Ecosystems:** Dominated by trees.
    *   **Grassland Ecosystems:** Vast open spaces of grass.
    *   **Desert Ecosystems:** Dry, often hot.
    *   **Tundra Ecosystems:** Cold, windy, little rainfall.
*   **Aquatic Ecosystems:** Water-based.
    *   **Freshwater Ecosystems:** Rivers, lakes, wetlands.
    *   **Marine Ecosystems:** Oceans, coral reefs.

---

## Forest Ecosystem

*   **Flora:** Plants of a particular region.
*   **Fauna:** Animals of a particular region.
