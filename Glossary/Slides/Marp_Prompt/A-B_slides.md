# Glossary: A-B

---

### Abiotic

*   **Definition:** Non-living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and ecosystems.
*   **Examples:** Sunlight, Temperature, Water, Soil.
*   **Context:** Determine which organisms can survive in an environment.

---

### Adaptation

*   **Definition:** A trait with a current functional role in an organism's life, maintained and evolved by natural selection. Can be structural, behavioral, or physiological.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Structural:** Streamlined body of a dolphin.
    *   **Behavioral:** Bird migration.
    *   **Physiological:** Camel's water storage.
*   **Context:** Adaptations are essential for survival and reproduction, key mechanism of evolution.

---

### Allele

*   **Definition:** One of a number of alternative forms of the same gene or genetic locus. Responsible for variation in a trait.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Blood Type (A, B, O alleles).
    *   Hair Color.
    *   Flower Color.
*   **Context:** Basis of genetic diversity, essential for species adaptation.

### ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)

*   **Definition:** Complex organic chemical providing energy for cellular processes (muscle contraction, nerve impulse, synthesis). "Molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy transfer.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Muscle Contraction.
    *   Active Transport.
    *   DNA Synthesis.
*   **Context:** Primary energy source for most cellular processes. Produced during cellular respiration and photosynthesis.

---

### Autotroph

*   **Definition:** Organism that produces complex organic compounds from simple substances (light or inorganic reactions). Producers in a food chain.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Plants (use sunlight).
    *   Algae.
    *   Cyanobacteria.
*   **Context:** Foundation of all ecosystems, provide energy and organic matter for other organisms.

---

### Biology

*   **Definition:** Natural science studying life and living organisms (physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiology, development, evolution).
*   **Examples:**
    *   Zoology (animals).
    *   Botany (plants).
    *   Microbiology (microorganisms).
    *   Genetics (heredity).
*   **Context:** Essential for understanding the world, human body, diseases, environment.

---

### Biotic

*   **Definition:** A living component of an ecosystem (e.g., a plant or animal). Categorized as producers, consumers, and decomposers.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Producers:** Plants, algae.
    *   **Consumers:** Animals.
    *   **Decomposers:** Bacteria, fungi.
*   **Context:** Interact with each other and abiotic factors to create complex ecosystems. Relationships can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral.
