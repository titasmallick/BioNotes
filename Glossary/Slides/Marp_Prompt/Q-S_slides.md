### Respiration

*   **Definition:** A process in living organisms involving the production of energy, typically with the intake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide from the oxidation of complex organic substances. Respiration is a three-step process that involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Glycolysis:** The breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, which takes place in the cytoplasm.
    *   **The Krebs cycle:** The oxidation of pyruvate to carbon dioxide, which takes place in the mitochondria.
    *   **Oxidative phosphorylation:** The production of ATP from the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, which takes place in the mitochondria.

*   **Context:** Respiration is the process by which most of the energy in living organisms is produced. It is essential for all life processes, including growth, reproduction, and movement.

### Species

*   **Definition:** A group of living organisms consisting of similar individuals capable of exchanging genes or interbreeding. The species is the principal natural taxonomic unit, ranking below a genus and denoted by a Latin binomial, e.g., Homo sapiens.

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Humans:** Homo sapiens
    *   **Dogs:** Canis lupus familiaris
    *   **Cats:** Felis catus

*   **Context:** The concept of a species is fundamental to biology and to our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth. It is used to classify organisms and to study their evolutionary relationships.
