# Blood Cell Identification

## Objective

*   To identify different types of blood cells (RBCs, WBCs, platelets) from a permanent blood smear slide under a microscope.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Microscope Setup:** Place blood smear slide, start with low power, then high power/oil immersion.
2.  **Focusing:** Adjust for clear view.
3.  **Identification:** Systematically scan and identify:
    *   **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):** Biconcave, anucleated, numerous, pale yellow.
    *   **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):** Larger, nucleated, less numerous. Differentiate between:
        *   **Granulocytes:** Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils.
        *   **Agranulocytes:** Lymphocytes, Monocytes.
    *   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Small, irregular fragments, anucleated, clumped.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of each identified cell type.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to distinguish and identify different blood cell types based on their morphology (size, shape, nucleus, granules) from a prepared blood smear.
