# Mitosis Stages Microscopy

## Objective

*   To observe and identify different stages of mitosis from permanent slides.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Microscope Setup:** Place permanent slide of mitosis stages, start with lowest power.
2.  **Focusing:** Adjust for clear focus.
3.  **Scanning:** Systematically scan to locate cells undergoing mitosis.
4.  **High Power Observation:** Switch to higher power for detailed view.
5.  **Identification:** Identify characteristic features of each stage:
    *   **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope disappears.
    *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at metaphase plate.
    *   **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate, move to opposite poles.
    *   **Telophase:** Chromosomes decondense, nuclear envelopes reform, cytokinesis begins.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of each identified stage.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to recognize and differentiate between the various stages of cell division (mitosis) in plant cells from prepared slides.
