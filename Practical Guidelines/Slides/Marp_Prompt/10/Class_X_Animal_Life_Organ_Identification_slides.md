# Animal Organ Identification

## Objective

*   To identify and understand the internal structure of the mammalian urinary system, heart, kidney, and the external view of the brain using models, charts, or preserved specimens.

---

## Guidelines Summary

### 1. Urinary System

*   **Identification:** Kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra.
*   **Structure/Function:** Basic role in urine formation/excretion.
*   **Drawing:** Labeled diagram.

---

### 2. Heart

*   **Identification:** Four chambers, major blood vessels, valves.
*   **Blood Flow:** Trace path through heart.
*   **Drawing:** Labeled diagram of internal structure.

---

### 3. Kidney

*   **External View:** Renal capsule, renal artery, renal vein, ureter.
*   **Internal Structure (L.S.):** Renal cortex, medulla (pyramids), pelvis, calyces.
*   **Function:** Role in filtration and urine formation.
*   **Drawing:** Labeled diagram of longitudinal section.

---

### 4. External View of Brain

*   **Identification:** Cerebrum (lobes), cerebellum, brainstem (pons, medulla).
*   **Surface Features:** Gyri and sulci on cerebrum.
*   **Function (Brief):** General functions of major parts.
*   **Drawing:** Labeled diagram of external view.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to identify and label key parts of mammalian urinary system, heart, kidney, and brain.
*   Understand their basic anatomical organization.
