# Plant Absorption Experiment

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the process of water absorption by a small herbaceous plant.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Plant Selection:** Use a small, healthy herbaceous plant (e.g., Balsam, money plant cutting).
2.  **Setup:** Fill measuring cylinder with water, add oil layer to prevent evaporation.
3.  **Plant Placement:** Insert plant, roots submerged, seal mouth with cork/cotton plug.
4.  **Initial Reading:** Note initial water level.
5.  **Observation:** Place in well-lit area. Observe water level after a few hours/overnight.
6.  **Recording:** Record final water level, calculate absorbed water.

## Expected Outcome

*   Noticeable decrease in water level in the measuring cylinder.
*   Demonstrates that the plant absorbs water through its roots.
