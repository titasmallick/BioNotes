# Diffusion Experiment

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the process of diffusion using potassium permanganate in water.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Setup:** Fill a beaker with clear, still water.
2.  **Introduction of Substance:** Carefully drop a few crystals of potassium permanganate (KMnOâ‚„) into the bottom.
3.  **Observation:** Observe how the purple color slowly spreads throughout the water without stirring.
4.  **Recording:** Record observations at regular intervals until color is uniformly distributed.
5.  **Explanation:** Explain that the movement is due to diffusion (particles moving from higher to lower concentration).

---

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear visual demonstration of diffusion, illustrating the random movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
