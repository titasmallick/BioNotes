# Osmosis Experiments

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the process of osmosis using the thistle funnel experiment and the potato osmoscope.

---

## Guidelines Summary

### 1. Thistle Funnel Experiment

1.  **Setup:** Thistle funnel with semi-permeable membrane tied across mouth.
2.  **Solution:** Fill funnel with concentrated sugar solution.
3.  **Immersion:** Invert funnel into beaker of distilled water (sugar solution level initially higher).
4.  **Observation:** Observe change in sugar solution level over hours.

---

### 2. Potato Osmoscope

1.  **Potato Preparation:** Peel potato, scoop cavity to create cup.
2.  **Setup:** Fill potato cavity with concentrated sugar solution. Insert pin at initial level.
3.  **Immersion:** Place potato in beaker of distilled water (water level below sugar solution in cavity).
4.  **Observation:** Observe change in sugar solution level over hours/overnight.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   In both experiments, an increase in the level of the sugar solution will be observed.
*   This demonstrates the net movement of water from higher water potential (distilled water) to lower water potential (sugar solution) across a semi-permeable membrane (osmosis).
