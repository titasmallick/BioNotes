# Transpiration Experiments

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the process of transpiration in plants and measure its rate.

---

## Guidelines Summary

### 1. Bell Jar Demonstration

*   **Setup:** Well-watered potted plant with soil covered, placed under sealed bell jar in sunlight.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Droplets of water appear on inner surface of bell jar, demonstrating water vapor release by transpiration.

### 2. Cobalt Chloride Paper Test for Unequal Transpiration

*   **Preparation:** Obtain dry blue cobalt chloride paper.
*   **Application:** Attach a piece of dry cobalt chloride paper to the upper surface and another piece to the lower surface of a healthy leaf.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The cobalt chloride paper on the lower surface of the leaf will turn pink faster and more intensely, indicating a higher rate of transpiration from the lower epidermis (more stomata).

### 3. Ganong’s Potometer – Measure Uptake of Water

*   **Setup:** Assemble the Ganong's potometer. Ensure it is completely filled with water and free of air bubbles. Insert a freshly cut, healthy twig into the apparatus, ensuring an airtight seal.
*   **Initial Reading:** Note the initial air bubble position.
*   **Observation:** Place the potometer in different environmental conditions (e.g., light, fan, dark), observe air bubble movement.
*   **Calculation:** Measure distance moved by bubble to calculate water uptake rate.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The air bubble will move, indicating water uptake. Rate varies with environmental factors.
