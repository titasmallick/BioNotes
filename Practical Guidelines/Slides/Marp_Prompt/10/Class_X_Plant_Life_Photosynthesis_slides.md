# Photosynthesis Experiments

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the necessity of light, carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll for starch production during photosynthesis.
*   To show the release of oxygen during photosynthesis.

---

## Guidelines Summary

### 1. Necessity of Light for Starch Production

*   **Setup:** Destarched plant, cover part of leaf with black paper, expose to sunlight.
*   **Starch Test:** Boil leaf (water, then alcohol), wash, iodine test.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The uncovered part of the leaf will turn blue-black (presence of starch), while the covered part will remain yellowish-brown (absence of starch).

---

### 2. Necessity of Carbon Dioxide for Starch Production

*   **Setup:** Destarched two potted plants. One with KOH (absorbs COâ‚‚), one with plain water (control). Expose to sunlight.
*   **Starch Test:** Perform iodine test on leaves.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Leaf from KOH setup shows no starch, control shows starch.

### 3. Necessity of Chlorophyll for Starch Production

*   **Setup:** Variegated leaf (e.g., Croton) from plant exposed to sunlight.
*   **Starch Test:** Perform iodine test on variegated leaf.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Only green parts turn blue-black, non-green parts remain yellowish-brown.

### 4. Release of Oxygen using Hydrilla/Elodea

*   **Setup:** Hydrilla/Elodea sprig in beaker with pond water, inverted test tube over it. Place in sunlight.
*   **Observation:** Bubbles evolve and collect in test tube.
*   **Gas Test:** Insert glowing splint into collected gas.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Splint rekindles, confirming oxygen release.
