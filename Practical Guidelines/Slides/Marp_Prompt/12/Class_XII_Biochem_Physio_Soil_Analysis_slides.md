# Soil Analysis

## Objective

*   To analyze soil samples from two different sites for texture, moisture content, humus content, water-holding capacity, and pH.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Sample Collection:** Collect representative soil samples from two distinct sites.
2.  **Texture Analysis:** Sedimentation method (mix with water, observe layers) or feel method.
3.  **Moisture Content:** Weigh fresh sample, dry in oven, re-weigh to calculate % moisture loss.
4.  **Humus Content:** Ignite dried sample, calculate % loss in weight (organic matter).
5.  **Water-Holding Capacity:** Saturate dry sample, drain excess, re-weigh to calculate water retained.
6.  **pH Measurement:** Prepare soil suspension, measure pH using paper/indicator/meter.
7.  **Data Recording:** Record all observations and calculations in tabular form.

## Expected Outcome

*   Comparative data on physical and chemical properties of soil from different locations, demonstrating variations in soil composition.
