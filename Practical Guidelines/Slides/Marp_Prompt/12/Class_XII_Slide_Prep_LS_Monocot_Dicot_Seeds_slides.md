# L.S. of Monocot & Dicot Seeds

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary longitudinal section (L.S.) of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous seeds and observe their internal structures.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Seed Preparation:** Soak monocot (e.g., maize, rice) and dicot (e.g., pea, bean) seeds in water overnight to soften.
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut a very thin longitudinal section of each seed, ensuring to cut through the embryo.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain sections with safranin or iodine.
4.  **Mounting:** Mount stained section in a drop of water on a slide, cover with coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope. Identify and compare:
    *   Seed Coat, Embryo (radicle, plumule, cotyledon(s)).
    *   Endosperm (presence/absence).
    *   Hilum/Micropyle.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of both monocot and dicot seed L.S., highlighting differences.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation and differentiation between the internal anatomical structures of monocot and dicot seeds, particularly the number of cotyledons and presence/absence of endosperm.
