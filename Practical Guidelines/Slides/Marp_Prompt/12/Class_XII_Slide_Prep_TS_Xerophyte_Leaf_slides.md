# T.S. of Xerophyte Leaf (Nerium)

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary transverse section (T.S.) of a xerophyte leaf (e.g., Nerium) and observe its anatomical adaptations to arid conditions.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Specimen Selection:** Obtain a fresh leaf of a xerophytic plant (e.g., Nerium).
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut very thin transverse sections of the leaf.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain sections with appropriate stains (e.g., safranin and fast green).
4.  **Mounting:** Mount stained section in a drop of water/glycerine on a slide, cover with coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope for characteristic adaptations:
    *   Thick Cuticle.
    *   Multiple Epidermis/Hypodermis.
    *   Sunken Stomata.
    *   Hairs/Trichomes.
    *   Well-developed Vascular Tissue.
    *   Sclerenchymatous Tissues.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagram, highlighting adaptive features.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation of anatomical features in a xerophyte leaf that facilitate water conservation and survival in dry environments.
