# Spotting

## Objective

*   To identify and draw various biological specimens, slides, charts, and models, and infer their characteristics or principles.

---

## Guidelines Summary

For each item presented (slide, chart, model, or specimen):
1.  **Identification:** Correctly identify the given item.
2.  **Drawing:** Make a neat, labeled diagram.
3.  **Observation:** Note down key observable features or structures.
4.  **Inference/Comment:** Briefly explain the biological significance, principle demonstrated, or classification.

## Items for Spotting (Examples)

### Slides/Charts/Models

*   T.S. of mammalian ovary/testis.
*   Germinating pollen grain.
*   Types of placentation.
*   Mammalian blastula/blastocyst.
*   *Plasmodium* sporozoite, *Entamoeba histolytica*.
*   *Ascaris* specimen.

### Adaptations

*   **Xeric Plants/Animals:** Identify organism and xeric adaptation(s). Draw, observe features (thick cuticle, sunken stomata, water storage, burrowing). Infer how adaptation helps survival in arid conditions.
*   **Aquatic Plants/Animals:** Identify organism and aquatic adaptation(s). Draw, observe features (aerenchyma, reduced roots, streamlined body, gills, webbed feet). Infer how adaptation helps survival in water.

### Pollination Types

*   **Insect Pollination (Entomophily):** Identify features (large, colorful petals, nectar, scent, sticky pollen). Draw, observe, infer how features facilitate insect pollination.
*   **Water Pollination (Hydrophily):** Identify features (small, inconspicuous flowers, pollen released on water surface, mucilaginous covering). Draw, observe, infer how features facilitate water pollination.
*   **Wind Pollination (Anemophily):** Identify features (small, inconspicuous flowers, no scent/nectar, feathery stigmas, abundant light pollen). Draw, observe, infer how features facilitate wind pollination.
