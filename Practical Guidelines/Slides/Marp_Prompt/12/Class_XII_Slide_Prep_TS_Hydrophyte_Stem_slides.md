# T.S. of Hydrophyte Stem

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary transverse section (T.S.) of a hydrophyte (aquatic plant) stem and observe its anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Specimen Selection:** Obtain a fresh stem of an aquatic plant (e.g., Hydrilla, Nymphaea).
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut very thin transverse sections of the stem.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain sections with dilute stain (e.g., safranin).
4.  **Mounting:** Mount stained section in a drop of water on a slide, cover with coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope for characteristic adaptations:
    *   Reduced Vascular Tissue.
    *   Large Air Chambers (Aerenchyma).
    *   Thin Cuticle/Absent Stomata.
    *   Poorly Developed Mechanical Tissues.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagram, highlighting adaptive features.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation of anatomical features in a hydrophyte stem that facilitate survival in an aquatic habitat.
