# T.S. of Ovary (Placentation)

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary transverse section (T.S.) of a flower ovary and observe different types of placentation (marginal or axile).

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Ovary Selection:** Obtain a fresh flower with a suitable ovary (e.g., pea for marginal, Hibiscus/tomato for axile).
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut a very thin transverse section of the ovary.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain the section with a dilute stain (e.g., safranin).
4.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained section in a drop of water/glycerine on a slide, cover with coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope. Identify ovary wall, locules, ovules, and their arrangement on the placenta.
6.  **Identification of Placentation:** Based on arrangement, identify marginal or axile type.
7.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagram, highlighting placentation type.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation and differentiation between marginal and axile placentation types within a flower ovary.
