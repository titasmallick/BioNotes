# Enzyme Action Experiment (Temperature & pH)

## Objective

*   To investigate the effect of varying temperature and pH on the activity of an enzyme (e.g., amylase) in breaking down starch.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Reagent Preparation:** Prepare starch solution, amylase solution, and buffer solutions of different pH values.
2.  **Temperature Experiment:**
    *   Set up test tubes with starch and amylase solutions at different temperatures (e.g., 0°C, 20°C, 37°C, 60°C, 100°C).
    *   Test for starch presence using iodine solution at regular intervals. Note time for starch to disappear.
3.  **pH Experiment:**
    *   Set up test tubes with starch, amylase, and buffer solutions of specific pH values (e.g., pH 4, 6, 7, 8, 10).
    *   Maintain constant optimal temperature (e.g., 37°C).
    *   Test for starch presence using iodine solution at regular intervals. Note time for starch to disappear.
4.  **Data Analysis:** Plot graphs of enzyme activity (1/time) against temperature and pH.

## Expected Outcome

*   Demonstration of optimal temperature and pH for enzyme activity.
*   Observation of decreased enzyme efficiency or denaturation when conditions deviate from optimum.
