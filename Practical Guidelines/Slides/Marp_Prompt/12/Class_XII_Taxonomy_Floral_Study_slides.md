# Floral Characteristics, Diagram & Formula

## Objective

*   To study the floral characteristics, construct the floral diagram, and write the floral formula for a representative plant from a given family.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Specimen Selection:** Choose a fresh flower from a specified family.
2.  **External Morphology:** Observe and note: inflorescence type, bracts, pedicel, symmetry (Actinomorphic/Zygomorphic), sexuality (Unisexual/Bisexual).
3.  **Dissection & Counting:** Carefully dissect and count parts in each whorl:
    *   **Calyx:** Sepals (number, aestivation, fusion).
    *   **Corolla:** Petals (number, aestivation, fusion).
    *   **Androecium:** Stamens (number, arrangement, fusion, anther attachment).
    *   **Gynoecium:** Carpels (number, fusion, ovary position, placentation).
4.  **Floral Diagram:** Draw a floral diagram (concentric circles, relative positions, fusion).
5.  **Floral Formula:** Write the floral formula using standard symbols.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to systematically analyze a flower, represent its structure through a floral diagram, and summarize its characteristics using a floral formula.
