# Pollen Grains Germination

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary mount of germinating pollen grains and observe the development of the pollen tube.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Pollen Collection:** Collect fresh pollen grains from a mature flower.
2.  **Germination Medium:** Prepare a sugar solution (e.g., 10% sucrose) on a clean glass slide.
3.  **Inoculation:** Dust pollen grains onto the sugar solution drop.
4.  **Incubation:** Keep slide in a moist chamber for 15-30 minutes or longer.
5.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope for pollen grains with developed pollen tubes.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of germinating pollen grains showing the pollen tube.

## Expected Outcome

*   Microscopic observation of pollen grains with elongated pollen tubes, illustrating the initial stage of fertilization in flowering plants.
