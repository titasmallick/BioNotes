# DNA Isolation from Plant Material

## Objective

*   To extract and observe DNA from common plant materials like banana, spinach, pea, or papaya.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Material Preparation:** Take a small amount of fresh plant material.
2.  **Homogenization:** Mash or blend plant material to break cells.
3.  **Lysis Buffer Preparation:** Prepare buffer with detergent (breaks membranes), salt (neutralizes DNA charge), and water.
4.  **Incubation:** Mix homogenized material with lysis buffer, incubate at warm temperature.
5.  **Filtration:** Filter mixture to remove large debris.
6.  **Enzyme Treatment (Optional):** Add protease to digest proteins.
7.  **DNA Precipitation:** Carefully add chilled ethanol or isopropanol. DNA will precipitate as white, stringy strands.
8.  **Observation:** Spool precipitated DNA onto a glass rod or observe in alcohol layer.

## Expected Outcome

*   Visible strands of DNA extracted from plant cells, demonstrating the presence of genetic material.
