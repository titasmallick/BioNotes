# Stomata Distribution Study

## Objective

*   To study and compare the distribution of stomata on the upper and lower surfaces of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous leaves.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Leaf Selection:** Obtain fresh leaves from a dicot plant (e.g., bean) and a monocot plant (e.g., maize).
2.  **Epidermal Peel Preparation:** Carefully peel off thin epidermal layers from both upper and lower surfaces of each leaf.
3.  **Mounting:** Mount each peel in a drop of water on a clean slide, cover with coverslip.
4.  **Observation:** Observe each slide under a compound microscope at high power. Count stomata in a defined field of view for both surfaces of both leaf types.
5.  **Comparison:** Compare stomata density on upper vs. lower surface for each leaf type, and overall distribution between dicot and monocot leaves.

## Expected Outcome

*   Observation that stomata are typically more abundant on the lower surface of dicot leaves (hypostomatous).
*   Stomata are more or less equally distributed on both surfaces of monocot leaves (amphistomatous).
