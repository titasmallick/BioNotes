# Plant Modifications Identification

## Objective

*   To identify and understand the structural modifications of roots, stems, and leaves for various functions (support, storage, reproduction).

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Specimen Collection:** Observe and collect diverse plant specimens showing modifications (e.g., carrot, banyan, ginger, pea, *Opuntia*).
2.  **Identification:** For each specimen, identify:
    *   The modified plant part (root, stem, or leaf).
    *   The type of modification (e.g., storage tap root, rhizome, stem tendril, leaf spine).
    *   The adaptive function (e.g., food storage, support, vegetative propagation, protection).
3.  **Drawing and Labeling:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of the observed modifications.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to recognize and classify different types of root, stem, and leaf modifications and explain their ecological significance.
