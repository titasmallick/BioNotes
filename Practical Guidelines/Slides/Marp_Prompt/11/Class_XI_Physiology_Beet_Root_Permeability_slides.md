# Beet Root Cell Membrane Permeability

## Objective

*   To investigate how temperature (heat) and organic solvents (alcohol) affect the permeability of cell membranes using beet root cells.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Sample Preparation:** Cut uniform pieces of beet root.
2.  **Experimental Setup:**
    *   **Heat:** Place beet root pieces in water baths at different temperatures (e.g., room temp, 40°C, 60°C, 80°C, boiling).
    *   **Alcohol:** Place beet root pieces in different concentrations of alcohol solutions (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
3.  **Observation:** Observe the intensity of red pigment (betacyanin) leakage into the surrounding solution over time. Compare color intensity.
4.  **Analysis:** Relate leakage to denaturation of membrane proteins and disruption of lipid bilayer by heat and alcohol.

## Expected Outcome

*   Demonstration that extreme temperatures and alcohol disrupt cell membrane integrity, leading to increased permeability and leakage of cellular contents.
