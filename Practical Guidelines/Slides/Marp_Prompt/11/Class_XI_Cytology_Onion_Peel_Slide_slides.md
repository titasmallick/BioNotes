# Onion Peel Slide Preparation (Plant Cell)

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary mount of onion epidermal peel and observe the structure of a typical plant cell.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Peel Preparation:** Carefully peel off a thin, transparent epidermal layer from the concave side of an onion scale leaf.
2.  **Mounting:** Place peel flat in a drop of water (or dilute stain) on a clean glass slide.
3.  **Coverslip:** Gently lower coverslip, avoiding air bubbles.
4.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope (low and high power). Identify cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, large central vacuole.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagram of observed onion cells.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation of plant cells, highlighting the presence of a distinct cell wall and a large central vacuole.
