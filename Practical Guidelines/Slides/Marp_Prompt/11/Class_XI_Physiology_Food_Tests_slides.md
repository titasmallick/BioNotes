# Food Tests

## Objective

*   To identify the presence of starch, glucose, sucrose, proteins, and fats in given food samples using specific chemical tests.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Preparation:** Prepare dilute solutions/suspensions of known and unknown food samples.
2.  **Test Procedures:** Follow standard protocols for each test:
    *   **Starch:** Iodine test.
    *   **Glucose (Reducing Sugar):** Benedict's test (heating).
    *   **Sucrose (Non-reducing Sugar):** Hydrolysis then Benedict's test.
    *   **Proteins:** Biuret test.
    *   **Fats:** Emulsion test (alcohol and water).
3.  **Observation:** Observe color changes, precipitate formation.
4.  **Recording:** Record observations in a table for controls and unknown samples. State inference.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear understanding of the chemical basis of food tests.
*   Ability to accurately identify major food components.
