# Spotting

## Objective

*   To identify and draw various biological specimens, slides, and experimental setups, and infer their characteristics or principles.

---

## Guidelines Summary

For each item presented (slide, specimen, or experimental setup):
1.  **Identification:** Correctly identify the item.
2.  **Drawing:** Make a neat, labeled diagram.
3.  **Observation:** Note key observable features or results.
4.  **Inference/Comment:** Briefly explain biological significance, principle demonstrated, or classification.

## Items for Spotting (Examples)

### Slides/Specimens

*   Meiosis stages (prepared slides), Mammalian blood cells (prepared slides), Bacteria (prepared slides).
*   Spirogyra (specimen/slide), Amoeba (specimen/slide), Yeast (specimen/slide).
*   Liverworts (specimen), Moss (specimen), Fern (specimen), Pinus (specimen), Mushroom (specimen).
*   Monocot (e.g., bamboo - specimen), Dicot (e.g., Petunia - specimen).
*   Sponge (specimen), Hydra (specimen), Tapeworm (specimen), Leech (specimen), Silkworm (specimen), Rohu fish (specimen).

### Experimental Setups

*   **Osmosis:** (e.g., Thistle funnel, potato osmoscope) - Identify, draw, observe liquid levels, infer water movement.
*   **Transpiration:** (e.g., Bell jar, Ganong's potometer) - Identify, draw, observe water loss/condensation, infer water vapor loss.
*   **Photosynthesis:** (e.g., Hydrilla for Oâ‚‚ evolution, Moll's half-leaf) - Identify, draw, observe gas bubbles/starch, infer photosynthesis process.
*   **Transpiration Pull:** (e.g., Cohesion-tension model) - Identify, draw, observe water movement, infer role in water ascent.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to identify, draw, and explain various biological items and experimental principles.
