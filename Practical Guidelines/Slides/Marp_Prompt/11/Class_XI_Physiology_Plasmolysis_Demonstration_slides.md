# Plasmolysis Demonstration

## Objective

*   To observe the phenomenon of plasmolysis in plant cells when exposed to a hypertonic solution.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Sample Preparation:** Obtain a thin epidermal peel from a Rhoeo leaf or onion bulb scale.
2.  **Mounting:** Mount peel in a drop of distilled water on a slide, observe normal turgid cells under microscope.
3.  **Inducing Plasmolysis:** Replace distilled water with a hypertonic solution (e.g., 5% NaCl) by adding to one side of coverslip and drawing under with filter paper.
4.  **Observation:** Observe cells under microscope. Note protoplast shrinking and detaching from cell wall.
5.  **Deplasmolysis (Optional):** Replace hypertonic solution with distilled water and observe cell recovery.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation of plasmolysed cells, where the protoplast shrinks and detaches from the cell wall, illustrating the effect of osmosis in plant cells.
