# Phyllotaxy, Leaf Types, Venation Study

## Objective

*   To observe and identify different patterns of phyllotaxy, types of leaves (simple/compound), and venation patterns in various plant specimens.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Specimen Collection:** Collect diverse plant specimens.
2.  **Phyllotaxy:** Observe leaf arrangement on stem:
    *   **Alternate:** (e.g., China rose)
    *   **Opposite:** (e.g., Guava)
    *   **Whorled:** (e.g., Alstonia)
3.  **Leaf Types:** Distinguish between:
    *   **Simple Leaf:** (e.g., Mango)
    *   **Compound Leaf:** (e.g., Neem) - classify as pinnately or palmately.
4.  **Venation:** Observe vein patterns:
    *   **Reticulate Venation:** (e.g., Dicot leaves like peepal)
    *   **Parallel Venation:** (e.g., Monocot leaves like grass)

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to accurately identify and classify phyllotaxy patterns, leaf types, and venation patterns in different plants.
