# Plant Pigment Chromatography

## Objective

*   To separate different photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, xanthophylls) from a plant extract using paper chromatography.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Pigment Extraction:** Grind fresh leaves with a solvent (e.g., acetone) to obtain crude pigment extract.
2.  **Chromatography Setup:**
    *   Apply concentrated pigment spot onto a pencil line near one end of chromatography paper.
    *   Place paper in jar with solvent mixture (e.g., petroleum ether and acetone), ensuring solvent level is below pigment spot.
3.  **Separation:** Allow solvent to ascend, separating pigments based on solubility/adsorption.
4.  **Observation:** Remove paper, mark solvent front. Observe and identify separated pigment bands by color.
5.  **Calculation (Optional):** Calculate Rf values.

## Expected Outcome

*   Successful separation of plant pigments into distinct bands on the chromatography paper, demonstrating the principle of chromatography.
