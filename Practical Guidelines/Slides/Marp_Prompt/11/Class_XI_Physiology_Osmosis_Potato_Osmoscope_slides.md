# Potato Osmoscope

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the process of osmosis using a potato tuber as a living osmoscope.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Potato Preparation:** Peel a large potato, scoop out a cavity to create a cup. Ensure base is flat.
2.  **Setup:** Fill potato cavity with concentrated sugar solution. Insert pin at initial level.
3.  **Immersion:** Place potato in beaker with distilled water (water level in beaker below sugar solution in cavity).
4.  **Observation:** Leave undisturbed for several hours/overnight. Observe change in sugar solution level.
5.  **Control (Optional):** Set up with distilled water in both potato cavity and beaker.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   An increase in the level of the sugar solution in the potato cavity.
*   Demonstrates net movement of water from higher water potential (distilled water) to lower water potential (sugar solution) across semi-permeable potato cells (osmosis).
