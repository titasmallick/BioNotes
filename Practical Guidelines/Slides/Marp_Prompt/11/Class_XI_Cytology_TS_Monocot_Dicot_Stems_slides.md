# T.S. of Monocot & Dicot Stems

## Objective

*   To prepare and observe temporary transverse sections (T.S.) of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous stems to study their anatomical differences.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Sectioning:** Obtain fresh monocot/dicot stems. Cut very thin transverse sections.
2.  **Staining:** Stain sections with appropriate stains (e.g., safranin and fast green).
3.  **Mounting:** Mount stained sections in glycerine/water on a slide, cover with coverslip.
4.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope. Identify and compare:
    *   Epidermis, Cortex.
    *   **Vascular Bundles:** Arrangement (scattered in monocots, ring in dicots), presence/absence of cambium.
    *   **Pith:** Central ground tissue (present in dicots, absent/reduced in monocots).
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of both monocot and dicot stem T.S., highlighting differences.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear understanding and ability to differentiate between the internal anatomical structures of monocot and dicot stems.
