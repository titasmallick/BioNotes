# Photosynthesis: Effect of CO₂ Concentration

## Objective

*   To investigate how varying concentrations of carbon dioxide affect the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants (e.g., Hydrilla).

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Setup:** Place aquatic plant sprig (e.g., Hydrilla) in beaker of water. Invert test tube over plant to collect gas bubbles.
2.  **CO₂ Variation:** Add varying amounts of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) to water.
3.  **Measurement:** Count oxygen bubbles evolved per unit time (e.g., per minute) for each CO₂ concentration.
4.  **Control Variables:** Keep light intensity and temperature constant.
5.  **Data Analysis:** Plot graph of photosynthesis rate (bubbles/minute) vs. CO₂ concentration.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   Observation that the rate of photosynthesis increases with increasing CO₂ concentration up to a certain point, demonstrating CO₂ as a limiting factor.
