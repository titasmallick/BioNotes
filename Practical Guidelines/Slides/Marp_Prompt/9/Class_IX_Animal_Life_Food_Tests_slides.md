# Food Tests

## Objective

*   To identify the presence of sugar, starch, protein, and fat in given food samples using appropriate biochemical tests.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Preparation:** Prepare dilute solutions/suspensions of known and unknown food samples.
2.  **Test Procedures:** Follow standard protocols for each test:
    *   **Sugar (Reducing Sugar):** Benedict's test (heating).
    *   **Starch:** Iodine test.
    *   **Protein:** Biuret test.
    *   **Fat:** Emulsion test (alcohol and water).
3.  **Observation:** Carefully observe color changes, precipitate formation, or other indicators.
4.  **Recording:** Create a table to record observations for both positive and negative controls, and for the unknown samples. Clearly state the inference for each test.

## Expected Outcome

*   A clear understanding of the chemical basis of food tests and the ability to accurately identify major food components.
