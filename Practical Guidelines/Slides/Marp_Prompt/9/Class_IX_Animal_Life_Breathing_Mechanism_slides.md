# Breathing Mechanism (Bell Jar Experiment)

## Objective

*   To demonstrate the mechanism of breathing (inhalation and exhalation) using a bell jar model and compare it with human lungs.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Model Setup:** Observe the bell jar model (bell jar = thoracic cavity, Y-tube = trachea/bronchi, balloons = lungs, rubber sheet = diaphragm).
2.  **Demonstration of Inhalation:** Pull rubber sheet downwards. Observe balloons inflate.
3.  **Demonstration of Exhalation:** Push rubber sheet upwards. Observe balloons deflate.
4.  **Comparison with Human Lungs:** Relate model movements to human breathing (diaphragm/rib cage movement, volume/pressure changes).
5.  **Discussion:** Explain role of pressure changes in thoracic cavity.

---

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear understanding of the physical mechanism of breathing, demonstrating how changes in thoracic volume and pressure lead to air movement into and out of the lungs.
