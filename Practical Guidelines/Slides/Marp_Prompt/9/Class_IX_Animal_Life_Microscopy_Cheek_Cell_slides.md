# Human Cheek Cell Microscopy

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary mount of human cheek cells and observe the structure of a typical animal cell.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Sample Collection:** Gently scrape inner lining of cheek with sterile toothpick.
2.  **Mounting:** Transfer scraped material to a drop of saline/water on a clean slide. Add methylene blue stain.
3.  **Coverslip:** Gently lower coverslip, avoiding air bubbles.
4.  **Observation:** Observe under microscope (low and high power). Identify cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus. Note irregular shape and absence of cell wall.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagram of observed cheek cells.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation of animal cells, highlighting the presence of a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus, and the absence of a cell wall.
