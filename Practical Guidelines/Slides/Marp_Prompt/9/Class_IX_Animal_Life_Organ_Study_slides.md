# Animal Organ Study (Lung and Skin)

## Objective

*   To identify and understand the basic structure and function of the human lung and skin using specimens, models, or charts.

---

## Guidelines Summary

### 1. Lung

*   **Identification:** Observe external features (color, texture, lobes).
*   **Internal Structure (Brief):** Understand air pathway (trachea -> bronchi -> bronchioles -> alveoli). Identify pleura.
*   **Function:** Understand primary role in gaseous exchange.
*   **Drawing:** Labeled diagram of human lung and air passages.

---

### 2. Skin

*   **Identification:** Observe model or chart.
*   **Layers:** Identify epidermis, dermis, hypodermis.
*   **Associated Structures:** Locate hair follicles, glands, nerve endings, blood vessels.
*   **Function:** Understand roles in protection, temperature regulation, sensation, excretion, vitamin D synthesis.
*   **Drawing:** Labeled diagram of skin cross-section.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to identify and label key parts of human lung and skin.
*   Understand their basic anatomical organization and physiological functions.
