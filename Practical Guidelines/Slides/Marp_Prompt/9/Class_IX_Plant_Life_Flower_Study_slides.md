# Flower Study (Cross-Pollinated Flower)

## Objective

*   To examine and identify the parts of a cross-pollinated flower, such as Hibiscus.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Specimen Selection:** Obtain a fresh, large, and easily dissectible cross-pollinated flower (e.g., Hibiscus).
2.  **External Observation:** Observe overall structure, color, scent, nectar guides.
3.  **Identification of Floral Whorls:** Identify and count parts of each whorl:
    *   **Calyx:** Sepals.
    *   **Corolla:** Petals.
    *   **Androecium:** Stamens.
    *   **Gynoecium:** Pistil/Carpels.
4.  **Dissection:** Carefully dissect flower to separate parts. Observe stamen/pistil arrangement.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagram of entire flower and dissected parts.
6.  **Discussion:** Relate features to cross-pollination adaptations.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to identify and label different parts of a flower and understand their role in reproduction, particularly in the context of cross-pollination.
