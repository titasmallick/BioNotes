# Animal Specimen Identification

## Objective

*   To identify and classify various animal specimens from different phyla/classes of Non-Chordata and Chordata.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Observation:** Carefully observe external features of each specimen (preserved, models, charts).
2.  **Key Characteristics:** Note distinguishing characteristics for classification (e.g., symmetry, segmentation, appendages, skeleton, body covering).
3.  **Classification:** Identify phylum/class based on observed characteristics.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams, highlighting key features.
5.  **Discussion:** Briefly describe habitat, general characteristics, economic importance.

## Specimens for Identification (Examples)

### Non-Chordata

*   **Porifera:** (e.g., Sycon) - porous body.
*   **Cnidaria:** (e.g., Hydra) - radial symmetry, stinging cells.
*   **Platyhelminthes:** (e.g., Tapeworm) - flat body.
*   **Nematoda:** (e.g., Ascaris) - cylindrical, unsegmented.
*   **Annelida:** (e.g., Earthworm) - segmented body.
*   **Arthropoda:** (e.g., Cockroach) - jointed legs, exoskeleton.
*   **Mollusca:** (e.g., Snail) - soft body, often shelled.
*   **Echinodermata:** (e.g., Starfish) - spiny skin, water vascular system.

---

### Chordata

*   **Pisces (Fish):** (e.g., Rohu) - fins, scales, gills.
*   **Amphibia:** (e.g., Frog) - moist skin, dual habitat.
*   **Reptilia:** (e.g., Lizard) - dry scaly skin.
*   **Aves (Birds):** (e.g., Pigeon) - feathers, wings.
*   **Mammalia:** (e.g., Rat) - hair/fur, mammary glands.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to identify and classify common animal specimens into their respective phyla/classes based on distinguishing morphological features.
