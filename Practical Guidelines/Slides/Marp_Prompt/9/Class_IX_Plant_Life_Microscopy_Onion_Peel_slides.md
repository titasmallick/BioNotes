# Onion Peel Microscopy

## Objective

*   To prepare a temporary mount of onion epidermal peel and observe the structure of a typical plant cell.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Peel Preparation:** Carefully peel off a thin, transparent epidermal layer from the concave side of an onion scale leaf.
2.  **Mounting:** Place the peel flat in a drop of water (or dilute stain) on a clean glass slide.
3.  **Coverslip:** Gently lower a coverslip over the peel, avoiding air bubbles.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope at low and high power. Identify the cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, and large central vacuole.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of a few observed onion cells.

## Expected Outcome

*   Clear microscopic observation of plant cells, highlighting the presence of a distinct cell wall and a large central vacuole.
