# Seed Study (Germinating Seeds)

## Objective

*   To examine and identify the plumule and radicle in germinating dicot (bean) and monocot (maize) seeds.

---

## Guidelines Summary

1.  **Seed Preparation:** Soak bean and maize seeds overnight to initiate germination, or use already germinating seeds.
2.  **External Observation:** Observe external features of both germinating seeds.
3.  **Dissection (if necessary):** For bean, remove seed coat, separate cotyledons to expose embryo. For maize, cut longitudinal section.
4.  **Identification:** Identify:
    *   **Radicle:** Embryonic root.
    *   **Plumule:** Embryonic shoot.
    *   **Cotyledon(s):** Seed leaves (food storage).
    *   **Seed Coat:** Outer protective layer.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of germinating bean and maize seeds, highlighting plumule and radicle.

## Expected Outcome

*   Ability to identify the embryonic root (radicle) and shoot (plumule) in germinating monocot and dicot seeds, understanding their roles in seedling development.
