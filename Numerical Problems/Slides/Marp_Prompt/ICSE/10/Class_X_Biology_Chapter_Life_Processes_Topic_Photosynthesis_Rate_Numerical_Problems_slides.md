# Photosynthesis Rate Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Rate of Oxygen Release

A hydrilla plant releases 10 bubbles of oxygen in 5 minutes when kept under optimal conditions. If the experiment is repeated with the same plant but under conditions of higher light intensity, and it releases 15 bubbles in 5 minutes, what is the percentage increase in the rate of photosynthesis?

## Problem 2: Carbon Dioxide Uptake (Conceptual)

If a plant absorbs 6 molecules of carbon dioxide to produce one molecule of glucose during photosynthesis, how many molecules of carbon dioxide would be required to produce 5 molecules of glucose?
