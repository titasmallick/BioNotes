# Numerical Problems: Photosynthesis

---

**Question 1:** In an experiment demonstrating that oxygen is released during photosynthesis, an aquatic plant (Hydrilla) releases 80 bubbles in 4 minutes when placed in bright sunlight. When the same setup is moved to a dimly lit area, the plant releases only 20 bubbles in 4 minutes.
(a) What is the rate of photosynthesis in bright sunlight (in bubbles/min)?
(b) What is the rate of photosynthesis in dim light (in bubbles/min)?
(c) Calculate the percentage decrease in the rate of photosynthesis when the plant was moved to dim light.
