# Ecological Pyramids Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Pyramid of Energy Calculation

In an ecosystem, the producers have 100,000 Joules (J) of energy. If the energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels is 10%, calculate the energy available at the tertiary consumer level.

## Problem 2: Biomass Transfer (Conceptual)

If 1000 kg of producers are required to support 100 kg of primary consumers, how much biomass of primary consumers would be needed to support 1 kg of secondary consumers, assuming the same transfer efficiency?
