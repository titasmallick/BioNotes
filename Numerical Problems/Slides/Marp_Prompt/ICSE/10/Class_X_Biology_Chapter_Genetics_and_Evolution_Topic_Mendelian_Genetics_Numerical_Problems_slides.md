# Mendelian Genetics Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Monohybrid Cross

In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant over dwarf (t). If a homozygous tall pea plant is crossed with a homozygous dwarf pea plant, what will be the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of the F1 generation?

---

## Problem 2: Dihybrid Cross

In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant over wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant over green seeds (y). If a pea plant heterozygous for both traits (RrYy) is self-pollinated, what will be the phenotypic ratio of the offspring?
