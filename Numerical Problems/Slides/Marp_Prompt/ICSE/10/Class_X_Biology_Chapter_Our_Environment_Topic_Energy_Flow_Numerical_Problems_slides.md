# Energy Flow in Ecosystems Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Ten Percent Law of Energy Transfer

If producers in an ecosystem have 10,000 Joules (J) of energy, how much energy will be available to the secondary consumers?

---

## Problem 2: Calculating Energy Loss

In a food chain, if the primary consumers obtain 500 J of energy from the producers, how much energy was lost during the transfer from producers to primary consumers?
