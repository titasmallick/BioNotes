# Numerical Problems: Photosynthesis and Transpiration

## Transpiration

**Question 1:** A student uses a Ganong's potometer to measure the rate of water uptake by a leafy shoot. The experiment shows that the air bubble moved a distance of 50 mm in 15 minutes. The capillary tube of the potometer has a radius of 0.7 mm. Calculate the rate of water uptake in mm³/min. (Assume π = 3.14).

**Question 2:** A potted plant was weighed and found to be 5.6 kg. The pot and the soil surface were covered with a waterproof plastic sheet. After keeping the plant in bright sunlight for 5 hours, its weight was measured again and found to be 5.54 kg. What is the rate of water loss by transpiration in g/hour?

## Photosynthesis

**Question 3:** In an experiment demonstrating that oxygen is released during photosynthesis, an aquatic plant (Hydrilla) releases 80 bubbles in 4 minutes when placed in bright sunlight. When the same setup is moved to a dimly lit area, the plant releases only 20 bubbles in 4 minutes.
(a) What is the rate of photosynthesis in bright sunlight (in bubbles/min)?
(b) What is the rate of photosynthesis in dim light (in bubbles/min)?
(c) Calculate the percentage decrease in the rate of photosynthesis when the plant was moved to dim light.
