# Reflex Arc Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Time Taken for a Reflex Action (Conceptual)

If the nerve impulse travels at an average speed of 100 meters per second (m/s) and a reflex arc involves a total neural pathway length of 0.5 meters, how long (in milliseconds) would it take for the reflex action to occur?

## Problem 2: Number of Synapses in a Polysynaptic Reflex (Conceptual)

A polysynaptic reflex involves an interneuron between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron. If a reflex arc has one sensory neuron, one interneuron, and one motor neuron, how many synapses are involved in this reflex pathway?
