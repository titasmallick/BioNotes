# Numerical Problems: Genetics

**Question 1:** In pea plants, tallness (T) is dominant over dwarfness (t). A heterozygous tall plant (Tt) is crossed with a homozygous dwarf plant (tt). What are the expected phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the offspring?

---

**Question 2:** In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant to green seeds (y). A plant that is heterozygous for both traits (RrYy) is self-pollinated. What is the probability of obtaining an offspring with wrinkled, green seeds?

**Question 3:** A man with normal vision marries a woman who is a carrier for colour blindness (an X-linked recessive trait). Let Xc represent the allele for colour blindness and X represent the normal allele. What is the probability that their son will be colour-blind? What is the probability that their daughter will be a carrier?
