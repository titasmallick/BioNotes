# Respiration in Plants - Numerical Problems

---

**Question 1:**
In aerobic respiration, one molecule of glucose is completely broken down. How many molecules of ATP are typically produced from this process?

---

**Question 2:**
Compare the energy yield of aerobic respiration versus anaerobic respiration (alcoholic fermentation) from one molecule of glucose. What is the difference in ATP molecules produced?

---

**Question 3:**
Write the balanced chemical equation for aerobic respiration, indicating the reactants and products.

---

**Question 4:**
Write the balanced chemical equation for anaerobic respiration (alcoholic fermentation) in plants/yeast, indicating the reactants and products.

---

**Question 5:**
If a plant cell needs to produce 76 molecules of ATP through aerobic respiration, how many glucose molecules would it need to break down?
