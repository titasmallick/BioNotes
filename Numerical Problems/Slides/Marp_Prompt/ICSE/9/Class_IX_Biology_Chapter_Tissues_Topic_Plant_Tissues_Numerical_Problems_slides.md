# Plant Tissues Numerical Problems (Conceptual)

---

## Problem 1: Calculating Cell Division Rate (Conceptual)

If a meristematic cell divides every 24 hours, and you start with one such cell, how many cells would you have after 3 days, assuming all daughter cells also divide at the same rate?

## Problem 2: Area Covered by Epidermal Cells (Conceptual)

Imagine a single layer of epidermal cells covering a leaf surface. If each epidermal cell is roughly square-shaped with sides of 20 micrometers (µm), how many such cells would be needed to cover a square area of 1 square millimeter (mm²)?
