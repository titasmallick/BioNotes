# Magnification and Size Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Calculating Actual Size

A diagram of a cell shows its image size as 50 mm. If the magnification of the diagram is 500X, what is the actual size of the cell in micrometers (µm)?

## Problem 2: Calculating Magnification

An actual bacterium is 2 µm long. If its image under a microscope appears to be 10 mm long, what is the magnification of the microscope?
