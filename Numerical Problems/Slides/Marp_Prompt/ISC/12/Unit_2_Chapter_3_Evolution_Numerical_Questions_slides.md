# Evolution - Numerical Questions

---

### Question 1: Calculating Allele Frequencies

In a population of 1000 individuals, 360 have the genotype AA, 480 have the genotype Aa, and 160 have the genotype aa. What are the frequencies of the alleles A and a in this population?

---

### Question 2: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

The frequency of a recessive allele in a population is 0.2. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype?

---

### Question 3: Application of Hardy-Weinberg Principle

In a population that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype is 0.09. What is the frequency of the dominant allele?

---

### Question 4: Predicting Genotype Frequencies

If the frequency of the dominant allele (A) in a population is 0.4, what are the expected frequencies of the genotypes AA, Aa, and aa, assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
