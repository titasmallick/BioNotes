# Immunity Numerical Problems (Conceptual)

## Problem 1: Antibody Production Rate (Conceptual)

After a primary exposure to an antigen, the body starts producing antibodies after about 7 days, and the antibody level peaks around 14 days. In a secondary exposure to the same antigen, antibodies are produced within 2 days and reach a much higher peak in 7 days. If the primary response produces 100 units of antibodies at its peak, and the secondary response produces 10 times more antibodies, how many units of antibodies are produced at the peak of the secondary response?

## Problem 2: Vaccine Efficacy (Conceptual)

In a clinical trial for a new vaccine, out of 1000 vaccinated individuals, 20 contracted the disease. In a control group of 1000 unvaccinated individuals, 200 contracted the disease. Calculate the efficacy of the vaccine.
