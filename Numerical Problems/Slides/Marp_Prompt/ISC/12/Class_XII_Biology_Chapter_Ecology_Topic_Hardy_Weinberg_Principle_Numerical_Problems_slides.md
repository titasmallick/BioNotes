# Hardy-Weinberg Principle Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Allele Frequencies Calculation

In a population of 1000 individuals, 360 are homozygous dominant (AA), 480 are heterozygous (Aa), and 160 are homozygous recessive (aa). Calculate the frequencies of the dominant allele (p) and the recessive allele (q).

## Problem 2: Genotype Frequencies from Allele Frequencies

If the frequency of the recessive allele (q) for a certain trait in a population is 0.3, and the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what are the frequencies of the homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive genotypes?
