# Organisms and Populations - Numerical Questions

---

### Question 1: Population Density

In a 200 square kilometer forest, there are 400 deer. What is the population density of the deer?

---

### Question 2: Population Growth Rate

A population of 500 insects has a birth rate of 100 insects per year and a death rate of 40 insects per year. Assuming no immigration or emigration, what is the net increase in the population in one year?

---

### Question 3: Exponential Growth

A population of bacteria is growing exponentially. The initial population size is 1000, and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is 0.2 per hour. What will be the population size after 5 hours?

---

### Question 4: Logistic Growth

A population of fish has a carrying capacity (K) of 2000. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is 0.3 per year. If the current population size (N) is 500, what is the population growth rate (dN/dt)?

### Question 5: Allele Frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg)

In a population of butterflies, the color brown (B) is dominant over the color white (b). 40% of all butterflies are white. Given this information, calculate the percentage of butterflies in the population that are heterozygous.
