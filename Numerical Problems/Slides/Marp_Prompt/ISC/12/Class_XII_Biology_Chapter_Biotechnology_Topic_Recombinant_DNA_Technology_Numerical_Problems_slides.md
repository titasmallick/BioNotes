# Recombinant DNA Technology Numerical Problems

## Problem 1: Calculating Number of Restriction Sites

A plasmid DNA is 5000 base pairs (bp) long. A restriction enzyme EcoRI recognizes a 6-base pair recognition sequence. Assuming the bases are randomly distributed and occur with equal frequency, approximately how many EcoRI recognition sites would you expect to find in this plasmid?

## Problem 2: Calculating DNA Concentration after Ligation

You have 100 ng of a plasmid vector (5 kb) and you want to ligate an insert DNA fragment (1 kb) into it. For optimal ligation, a vector:insert molar ratio of 1:3 is desired. How much insert DNA (in ng) should you add to the ligation reaction?
