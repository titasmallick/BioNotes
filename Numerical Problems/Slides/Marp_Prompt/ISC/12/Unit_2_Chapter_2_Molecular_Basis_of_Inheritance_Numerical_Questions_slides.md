# Molecular Basis of Inheritance - Numerical Questions

---

### Question 1: DNA Structure and Chargaff's Rule

A double-stranded DNA molecule contains 20% Adenine (A). Calculate the percentages of Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C) in this DNA molecule.

---

### Question 2: DNA Length Calculation

A segment of a DNA molecule is 100 base pairs (bp) long. How many nucleotides are present in this segment?

---

### Question 3: Genetic Code and Polypeptide Chain

A polypeptide chain has 50 amino acids. What is the minimum number of nucleotides in the mRNA that codes for this polypeptide?

---

### Question 4: DNA Replication and Isotopes

If a DNA molecule is replicated for two generations in a medium containing <sup>14</sup>N, starting with a hybrid DNA molecule (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N), what will be the ratio of hybrid DNA to light DNA in the second generation?
