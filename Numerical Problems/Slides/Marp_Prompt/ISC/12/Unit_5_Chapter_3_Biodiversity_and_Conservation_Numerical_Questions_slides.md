# Biodiversity and Conservation - Numerical Questions

### Question 1: Species-Area Relationship

The species-area relationship is given by the equation log S = log C + Z log A. If the value of the regression coefficient (Z) is 0.2, the Y-intercept (C) is 0.5, and the area (A) is 100 square kilometers, what is the species richness (S)?

### Question 2: Calculating the Regression Coefficient (Z)

In a study of a forest ecosystem, it was found that the species richness (S) is 10 when the area (A) is 1000 square kilometers. If the Y-intercept (C) is 2, what is the value of the regression coefficient (Z)?

### Question 3: Impact of Area on Species Richness

For a particular group of organisms, the species-area relationship is described by the equation S = 5A<sup>0.3</sup>. If the area is increased from 100 km² to 200 km², what is the percentage increase in species richness?
