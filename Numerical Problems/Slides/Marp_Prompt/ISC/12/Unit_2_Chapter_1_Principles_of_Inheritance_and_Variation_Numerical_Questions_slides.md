# Principles of Inheritance and Variation - Numerical Questions

---

### Question 1: Monohybrid Cross

In pea plants, the allele for tallness (T) is dominant over the allele for dwarfness (t). A heterozygous tall plant is crossed with a dwarf plant. What will be the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the offspring?

---

### Question 2: Dihybrid Cross

In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant to green seeds (y). A plant that is heterozygous for both traits is self-pollinated. What is the probability of obtaining an offspring that is homozygous recessive for both traits?

---

### Question 3: Incomplete Dominance

In snapdragons, flower color is an example of incomplete dominance. The allele for red flowers (R) is incompletely dominant to the allele for white flowers (r). The heterozygous genotype (Rr) results in pink flowers. If two pink-flowered snapdragons are crossed, what are the expected phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the offspring?

### Question 4: Codominance and Blood Groups

A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group B. They have a child with blood group O. What are the genotypes of the parents and the child? What is the probability of them having a child with blood group AB?

### Question 5: Sex-Linked Inheritance

Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. A man with normal blood clotting marries a woman who is a carrier for hemophilia. What is the probability of their children having hemophilia?
