# Ecosystem - Numerical Questions

---

### Question 1: Net Primary Productivity (NPP)

The Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) of a forest ecosystem is 50,000 kcal/m²/year. The energy used by the producers for their respiration (R) is 15,000 kcal/m²/year. What is the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of this ecosystem?

### Question 2: Energy Transfer (10% Law)

In a grassland ecosystem, the energy available at the producer level is 20,000 Joules. According to the 10% Law, how much energy will be available to the secondary consumers?

### Question 3: Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)

If the total incident solar radiation on a plant is 1,000,000 Joules, and the plant is able to capture 5% of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), which is 50% of the total incident radiation, how much energy is captured by the plant?

### Question 4: Pyramid of Biomass

In a pond ecosystem, the biomass of phytoplankton is 10 kg. If the biomass of zooplankton is 50 kg, and the biomass of small fish is 100 kg, what is the shape of the pyramid of biomass?

### Question 5: Trophic Level Energy Calculation

If the energy available to the tertiary consumers in a food chain is 15 kcal, how much energy was available at the producer level? (Assume the 10% Law of energy transfer).
