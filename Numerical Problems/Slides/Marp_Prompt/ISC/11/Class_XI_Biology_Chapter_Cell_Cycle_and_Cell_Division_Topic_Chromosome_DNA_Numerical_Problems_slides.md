# Chromosome and DNA Content Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Chromosome and DNA Content in Mitosis

A diploid somatic cell of an organism has 2n = 46 chromosomes and 2C amount of DNA in G1 phase. What will be the number of chromosomes and the amount of DNA in this cell after S phase and after Telophase of Mitosis?

## Problem 2: Chromosome and DNA Content in Meiosis

Consider a diploid cell with 2n = 4 chromosomes and 2C amount of DNA in G1 phase. What will be the number of chromosomes and the amount of DNA in the cell at the end of Meiosis I and at the end of Meiosis II (in each daughter cell)?
