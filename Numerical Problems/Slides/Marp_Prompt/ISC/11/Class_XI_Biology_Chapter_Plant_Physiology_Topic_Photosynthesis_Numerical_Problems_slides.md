# Photosynthesis Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: ATP and NADPH Production in Light Reaction

If 12 molecules of water are consumed during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, how many molecules of ATP and NADPH are theoretically produced?

## Problem 2: Carbon Dioxide Fixation in Calvin Cycle

How many turns of the Calvin cycle are required to produce one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6)? How many molecules of ATP and NADPH are consumed in this process?
