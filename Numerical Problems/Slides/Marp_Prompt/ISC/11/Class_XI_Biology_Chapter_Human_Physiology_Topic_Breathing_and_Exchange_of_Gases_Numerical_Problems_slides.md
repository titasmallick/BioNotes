# Breathing and Exchange of Gases Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Tidal Volume and Minute Ventilation

A person breathes 16 times per minute, and their tidal volume is 500 mL. Calculate their minute ventilation.

---

## Problem 2: Vital Capacity Calculation

Given the following lung volumes for an individual:
*   Tidal Volume (TV) = 500 mL
*   Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV) = 3000 mL
*   Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) = 1000 mL

Calculate the Vital Capacity (VC) of this individual.
