# Numerical Problems: Cardiac Cycle

---

**Q1: A person has a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. Calculate the duration of their cardiac cycle.**

---

**Q2: If a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds long, and the ventricular systole lasts for 0.3 seconds, what is the duration of ventricular diastole?**

---

**Q3: In a normal cardiac cycle of 0.8s, atrial systole is 0.1s, and ventricular systole is 0.3s. Calculate the duration of joint diastole.**
