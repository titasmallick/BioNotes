# Enzyme Activity Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Calculating Rate of Reaction

An enzyme catalyzes a reaction that produces 200 micromoles of product in 5 minutes. Calculate the rate of reaction in micromoles per minute.

## Problem 2: Effect of Temperature (Q10 Value - Conceptual)

The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature within a certain range (Q10 = 2). If a reaction proceeds at a rate of 5 units at 20°C, what would be its approximate rate at 40°C?
