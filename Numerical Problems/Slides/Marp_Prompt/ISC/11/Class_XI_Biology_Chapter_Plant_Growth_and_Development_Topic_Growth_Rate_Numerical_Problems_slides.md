# Growth Rate Numerical Problems

## Problem 1: Arithmetic Growth Rate

A plant stem initially measures 5 cm in length. After 10 days, its length increases to 15 cm. Assuming arithmetic growth, calculate the growth rate per day.

## Problem 2: Relative Growth Rate (Conceptual)

Plant A increases its leaf area from 10 cm² to 20 cm² in a week. Plant B increases its leaf area from 100 cm² to 110 cm² in the same week. Which plant shows a higher relative growth rate?
