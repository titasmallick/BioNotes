# Numerical Problems: Cell Cycle and Cell Division

---

**Q1: A diploid cell has a DNA content of 4C and 20 chromosomes in the G2 phase. What would be the DNA content and chromosome number in the daughter cells after mitosis?**

---

**Q2: If a human cell (2n=46) has a C-value of 3.2 pg, what is the DNA content (in pg) of a cell in Prophase I of meiosis?**

---

**Q3: A cell from an organism has 16 chromosomes and a DNA content of 20 pg in the G1 phase. What will be the number of chromosomes and DNA content in the G2 phase?**
