# Numerical Problems: Enzyme Kinetics

---

**Q1: An enzyme has a Vmax of 100 µM/s and a Km of 2mM. What is the velocity of the reaction when the substrate concentration is 2mM?**

---

**Q2: The Vmax for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is 60 µM/min. The Km is 1 mM. What is the substrate concentration when the velocity is 20 µM/min?**

---

**Q3: A Lineweaver-Burk plot gives a y-intercept of 0.05 (µM/min)⁻¹ and an x-intercept of -0.2 (mM)⁻¹. Calculate Vmax and Km.**

---

**Q4: An enzyme has a Km of 5x10⁻⁵ M. A competitive inhibitor is present at a concentration of 2x10⁻⁵ M, and the inhibitor constant Ki is 4x10⁻⁵ M. Calculate the apparent Km (Km_app).**
