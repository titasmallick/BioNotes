# Water Potential Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Calculating Water Potential

A plant cell has a solute potential (Ψs) of -0.7 MPa and a pressure potential (Ψp) of 0.3 MPa. Calculate the water potential (Ψ) of this cell.

## Problem 2: Water Movement Based on Water Potential

Cell A has a water potential of -0.5 MPa, and Cell B has a water potential of -0.8 MPa. In which direction will there be a net movement of water between these two cells?
