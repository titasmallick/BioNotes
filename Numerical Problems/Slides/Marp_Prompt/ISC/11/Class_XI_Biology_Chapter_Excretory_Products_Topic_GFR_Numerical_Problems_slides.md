# Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Numerical Problems

---

## Problem 1: Calculating GFR from Urine and Plasma Concentrations

In a healthy individual, the concentration of creatinine in plasma is 0.01 mg/mL, and its concentration in urine is 1.2 mg/mL. If the urine flow rate is 1 mL/minute, calculate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in mL/minute, assuming creatinine is freely filtered and not reabsorbed or secreted.

## Problem 2: Daily Urine Output (Conceptual)

If a person's GFR is 125 mL/minute, and 99% of the filtrate is reabsorbed, what is the approximate daily urine output in liters?
