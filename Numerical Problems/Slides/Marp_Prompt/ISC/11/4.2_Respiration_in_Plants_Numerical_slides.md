# Numerical Problems: Respiration in Plants

---

**Q1: Calculate the Respiratory Quotient (RQ) for the complete oxidation of Tripalmitin, a fatty acid with the formula C₅₁H₉₈O₆.**

---

**Q2: If 4 molecules of glucose enter glycolysis, what is the net production of ATP and NADH?**

---

**Q3: A plant is respiring using a substrate with the chemical formula C₄H₆O₅. Calculate the RQ.**

---

**Q4: In an experiment, 10 molecules of CO₂ are evolved and 10 molecules of O₂ are consumed. What is the RQ and what type of substrate is being used?**
