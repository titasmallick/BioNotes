# Competency-Based Question Bank: Principles of Inheritance and Variation

## Section A: Competency-Based Multiple Choice Questions (Application & Analysis)

**1. Analyze the Pedigree:** A male has a rare genetic disorder. He marries a healthy female. All their daughters are affected, but none of their sons are affected. What is the most likely mode of inheritance?
   a) Autosomal Dominant
   b) X-linked Dominant
   c) X-linked Recessive
   d) Y-linked
**Answer:** b) X-linked Dominant
**Explanation:** An affected father passes his X chromosome to all his daughters, making them affected. Sons receive the Y chromosome, so they are spared.

**2. Predict the Outcome:** In a cross between AABB and aabb, the F1 progeny is AaBb. If the genes are *completely linked* (0% recombination), what will be the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation?
   a) 9:3:3:1
   b) 1:1:1:1
   c) 3:1
   d) 1:2:1
**Answer:** c) 3:1
**Explanation:** In complete linkage, the alleles A and B stay together, and a and b stay together. The F1 (AB/ab) behaves like a single gene cross. F2 phenotypes will be the same as the parents (AABB and aabb) in a 3:1 ratio.

**3. Assertion (A):** Sickle-cell anaemia is an example of a point mutation.
   **Reason (R):** It involves the substitution of Glutamic acid by Valine at the 6th position of the beta-globin chain.
   a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
   b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
   c) A is true but R is false.
   d) A is false but R is true.
**Answer:** a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
**Explanation:** A single nucleotide change (GAG to GUG) results in a single amino acid change, which is the definition of a point mutation.

**4. Evaluate:** A couple, both carriers for Thalassemia (minor), want to know the risk of having a child with Thalassemia major. What is the probability?
   a) 100%
   b) 50%
   c) 25%
   d) 0%
**Answer:** c) 25%
**Explanation:** Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder. The cross is Tt x Tt (Heterozygous x Heterozygous). Offspring: 25% TT (Normal), 50% Tt (Carrier), 25% tt (Major).

**5. Calculate:** In a population of 100 individuals, 16 are homozygous recessive (aa). According to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the frequency of the heterozygous (Aa) individuals?
   a) 0.48
   b) 0.36
   c) 0.16
   d) 0.60
**Answer:** a) 0.48
**Explanation:** $q^2 = 0.16 ightarrow q = 0.4$. Then $p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$. Frequency of Aa ($2pq$) = $2 \times 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.48$.

**6. Analyze the blood group:** A child has blood group 'O'. The father has blood group 'A' and the mother has blood group 'B'. What are the genotypes of the parents?
   a) $I^A I^A$, $I^B I^B$
   b) $I^A i$, $I^B i$
   c) $I^A i$, $I^B I^B$
   d) $I^A I^A$, $I^B i$
**Answer:** b) $I^A i$, $I^B i$
**Explanation:** A child with group O has genotype $ii$. This means both parents must contribute one '$i$' allele.

**7. Identify the Phenomenon:** In *Mirabilis jalapa*, crossing a red-flowered plant with a white-flowered plant yields pink-flowered offspring. This is due to:
   a) Codominance
   b) Incomplete Dominance
   c) Epistasis
   d) Pleiotropy
**Answer:** b) Incomplete Dominance
**Explanation:** The dominant allele (Red) does not completely mask the recessive allele (White), resulting in a blended, intermediate phenotype (Pink).

**8. Assertion (A):** Frequency of crossing over between two genes is directly proportional to the physical distance between them.
   **Reason (R):** Genes located farther apart on a chromosome are more likely to undergo recombination.
   a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
   b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
   c) A is true but R is false.
   d) A is false but R is true.
**Answer:** a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
**Explanation:** As distance increases, the chance of a chiasma forming between those points increases, leading to higher recombination frequency.

**9. Clinical correlation:** A sterile female with a webbed neck, short stature, and karyotype 45,XO is diagnosed with:
   a) Down's Syndrome
   b) Klinefelter's Syndrome
   c) Turner's Syndrome
   d) Edwards Syndrome
**Answer:** c) Turner's Syndrome
**Explanation:** This is a chromosomal disorder caused by the loss of one X chromosome in females (Monosomy).

**10. Analyze:** Why does color blindness occur more frequently in males than in females?
    a) The gene is on the Y chromosome.
    b) Males have only one X chromosome, so a single recessive allele is expressed.
    c) Females have a stronger immune system against the defect.
    d) Males have higher testosterone levels affecting vision.
**Answer:** b) Males have only one X chromosome...
**Explanation:** Males are hemizygous. Since they have only one X, any recessive gene on it is expressed. Females (XX) need two recessive alleles to show the trait.

**11. Differentiate:** Which of the following differentiates *Polygenic Inheritance* from *Pleiotropy*?
    a) Polygenic: One gene -> Many traits; Pleiotropy: Many genes -> One trait.
    b) Polygenic: Many genes -> One trait; Pleiotropy: One gene -> Many traits.
    c) Polygenic involves blending; Pleiotropy involves dominance.
    d) Polygenic is qualitative; Pleiotropy is quantitative.
**Answer:** b) Polygenic: Many genes -> One trait; Pleiotropy: One gene -> Many traits.
**Explanation:** Height (Polygenic) is controlled by many genes. PKU (Pleiotropic) is one gene mutation affecting mental status, hair color, and skin color.

**12. Assertion (A):** In Honeybees, females are diploid (32 chromosomes) and males are haploid (16 chromosomes).
    **Reason (R):** Males develop parthenogenetically from unfertilized eggs.
    a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
    b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
    c) A is true but R is false.
    d) A is false but R is true.
**Answer:** a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
**Explanation:** This is the Haplodiploid sex determination system.

**13. Map the genes:** If recombination between A-B is 20%, B-C is 15%, and A-C is 35%, what is the order?
    a) A-C-B
    b) A-B-C
    c) B-A-C
    d) C-A-B
**Answer:** b) A-B-C
**Explanation:** The distance A-C is the largest (35 units). A-B (20) + B-C (15) = 35. Therefore, B must be in the middle of A and C.

**14. Identify the chromosomal disorder:** A karyotype shows 47, XX, +21. The individual has a broad palm with a simian crease and mental retardation.
    a) Patau Syndrome
    b) Down's Syndrome
    c) Turner's Syndrome
    d) Cri-du-chat Syndrome
**Answer:** b) Down's Syndrome
**Explanation:** It is caused by Trisomy of the 21st chromosome.

**15. Reasoning:** In T.H. Morgan's experiment on *Drosophila*, why did the 'white eye' and 'yellow body' genes show very low recombination (1.3%)?
    a) The genes were tightly linked.
    b) The genes were on different chromosomes.
    c) Mutation rates were high.
    d) Environment.
**Answer:** a) The genes were tightly linked.
**Explanation:** Tightly linked genes (physically close on the chromosome) rarely separate during crossing over.

## Section B: Case-Study & Source-Based Questions

### Case Study 1: The Royal Disease
Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder where blood fails to clot.

**16. Analyze:** If a carrier female marries a normal male, what is the probability of their **sons** being haemophilic?
    a) 0%
    b) 25%
    c) 50%
    d) 100%
**Answer:** c) 50%
**Explanation:** The mother is $X^H X^h$. Each son has a 50% chance of receiving the $X^h$ (affected) allele from her. (Note: Only looking at sons).

**17. Explain:** Why is it rare to find a female with haemophilia?
    **Answer:** To be haemophilic, a female must be $X^h X^h$. This requires a carrier/haemophilic mother AND a haemophilic father ($X^h Y$). Since haemophilic males often died young in the past, this combination was extremely rare.

**18. Contrast:** Difference between Haemophilia and Thalassemia?
    **Answer:** Haemophilia is a **sex-linked recessive** disorder (on X chromosome). Thalassemia is an **autosomal recessive** disorder (on autosomes).

### Case Study 2: Snapdragons
A gardener crosses pure red and pure white snapdragons. All F1 are pink.

**19. Identify:** The phenotypic ratio in F2?
    **Answer:** 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White (1:2:1 ratio).

**20. Interpret:** Does this disprove Mendel's Law of Segregation?
    **Answer:** No. Even though F1 was pink (blended), the original Red and White traits reappeared in F2. This proves the alleles themselves did not blend; they remained discrete and segregated.

### Case Study 3: T.H. Morgan's Flies
Morgan crossed yellow-bodied, white-eyed females with wild-type males.

**21. Deduce:** Why did the ratio deviate from 9:3:3:1?
    **Answer:** Because the genes for body color and eye color were **Linked** on the same chromosome (X). They did not assort independently as Mendel's laws assumed.

**22. Define:** Physical association of genes on a chromosome is called **Linkage**.

## Section C: Creating, Designing & Critical Thinking

**23. Designing a Cross:** Determine if a tall plant is TT or Tt.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Method:** Use a **Test Cross**. Cross the tall plant with a homozygous recessive dwarf plant (tt).
   *   **Prediction:**
       *   If all offspring are Tall -> Parent was **TT**.
       *   If 50% are Tall and 50% are Dwarf -> Parent was **Tt**.

**24. Formulating a Hypothesis:** Industrial Melanism.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Hypothesis:** Natural Selection favored dark moths after industrialization. Dark moths were better camouflaged on soot-covered trees, leading to higher survival and reproduction compared to white moths.

**25. Creating a Pedigree:** Autosomal Dominant disorder.
   **Answer:**
   *   Draw 3 generations. Generation 1 has one affected parent. At least one child in Gen 2 must be affected. In Gen 3, children of the affected Gen 2 parent must show the trait. No generations are skipped.

**26. Visualizing Development:** Sickle Cell hemoglobin.
   **Answer:**
   *   Describe the change: Normal DNA has **GAG** coding for **Glutamic Acid**. Mutant DNA has **GUG** coding for **Valine**. This hydrophobic valine causes hemoglobin to polymerize into fibers under low oxygen, distorting RBCs into a sickle shape.

**27. Analyzing Complexity:** Skin color is polygenic.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Genotypes:** Darkest = **AABBCC**; Lightest = **aabbcc**.
   *   **Gradient:** Because it is controlled by multiple genes, each dominant allele adds a small amount of pigment. With many possible combinations, you get a continuous spectrum of shades rather than just two categories.

**28. Debating Ethics:** Embryo selection (PGD).
   **Answer:**
   *   **FOR:** Prevents severe genetic suffering; parents should have the liberty to choose traits for their children's well-being.
   *   **AGAINST:** Could lead to "Eugenics" (creating a super-race); discriminates against the disabled; only accessible to the rich, widening the social gap.

**29. Solving a Genetic Puzzle:** Group A man + Group B woman = Group O daughter.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Is it possible?** Yes. Both parents must be heterozygous ($I^A i$ and $I^B i$).
   *   **Punnett Square:**
       *   Gametes: ($I^A$, $i$) and ($I^B$, $i$).
       *   Offspring: $I^A I^B$ (AB), $I^A i$ (A), $I^B i$ (B), **$ii$ (O)**.
   *   **Result:** Probability of a Group O child is 25%.

**30. Concept Map:**
   **Answer:**
   **Chromosome** -> contains -> **DNA** -> segments are -> **Genes** -> at specific -> **Loci** -> variations are -> **Alleles** -> pair is -> **Genotype** -> expresses -> **Phenotype**.
