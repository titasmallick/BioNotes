# Competency-Based Question Bank: Biodiversity and Conservation

## Section A: Competency-Based Multiple Choice Questions (Application & Analysis)

**1. Analyze the Data:** You are exploring a new island. You find that the number of bird species increases as you explore larger areas of the island. However, after exploring 70% of the island, the rate of discovering new species drops significantly. Which ecological concept does this observation best fit?
   a) Latitudinal Gradient
   b) Species-Area Relationship
   c) Resource Partitioning
   d) Competitive Exclusion
**Answer:** b) Species-Area Relationship
**Explanation:** Alexander von Humboldt observed that species richness increases with explored area, but only up to a limit (rectangular hyperbola). As you cover more area, you find fewer *new* species.

**2. Evaluate the Cause:** The passenger pigeon was once the most abundant bird in North America but is now extinct. What was the *primary* driver of this extinction?
   a) Habitat fragmentation due to urbanization.
   b) Introduction of an alien predator.
   c) Over-exploitation by humans for food.
   d) A viral disease outbreak.
**Answer:** c) Over-exploitation by humans for food.
**Explanation:** Humans hunted the passenger pigeon excessively for meat, leading to its rapid extinction despite its massive initial population.

**3. Predict the Impact:** If a "Keystone Species" (like the Fig tree in a tropical forest) is removed, what will be the immediate impact on the ecosystem?
   a) Only the species living on the fig tree will die.
   b) The ecosystem will become more stable.
   c) There will be a cascading effect leading to the extinction of many other species (e.g., birds, insects).
   d) Another tree species will immediately replace its function.
**Answer:** c) There will be a cascading effect leading to the extinction of many other species.
**Explanation:** Keystone species have a disproportionately large effect on their environment. Figs provide food during lean seasons for many frugivores; their removal causes a collapse of the food web.

**4. Assertion (A):** Tropical latitudes have greater biological diversity than temperate latitudes.
   **Reason (R):** Tropical environments are less seasonal, relatively more constant, and predictable.
   a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
   b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
   c) A is true but R is false.
   d) A is false but R is true.
**Answer:** a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
**Explanation:** Constant environments promote niche specialization and allow more species to coexist (Speciation), leading to higher diversity.

**5. Conservation Strategy:** A biologist wants to conserve the genetic diversity of a rare, wild variety of mango that is disappearing from the forest. Which conservation method is most appropriate for long-term preservation of its genes?
   a) Botanical Garden
   b) Biosphere Reserve
   c) Cryopreservation (Gene Bank)
   d) National Park
**Answer:** c) Cryopreservation (Gene Bank)
**Explanation:** For long-term storage of *genetic material* (seeds/tissues/gametes) specifically to preserve diversity ex-situ, cryopreservation (liquid nitrogen at -196°C) is the most effective method.

**6. Identify the Threat:** The introduction of the Nile Perch into Lake Victoria caused the extinction of over 200 species of Cichlid fish. This is a classic example of:
   a) Co-extinction
   b) Alien Species Invasion
   c) Habitat Loss
   d) Over-exploitation
**Answer:** b) Alien Species Invasion
**Explanation:** The Nile Perch was an exotic species introduced to the lake, and it preyed upon the native Cichlids, driving them to extinction.

**7. Ethical Reasoning:** "We should conserve every species, even if it has no direct economic value to humans." Which argument for biodiversity conservation does this statement represent?
   a) Narrowly Utilitarian
   b) Broadly Utilitarian
   c) Ethical
   d) Scientific
**Answer:** c) Ethical
**Explanation:** The ethical argument posits that every species has an intrinsic value and a right to exist, regardless of its utility to humans.

**8. Calculate:** In the Species-Area equation $log S = log C + Z log A$, if the Z-value (slope) is found to be 1.15 for frugivorous birds, what does this indicate about the area studied?
   a) It is a very small area.
   b) It is a large area, likely an entire continent.
   c) The species richness is decreasing.
   d) The calculation is wrong; Z cannot exceed 1.
**Answer:** b) It is a large area, likely an entire continent.
**Explanation:** The slope Z is usually 0.1-0.2 for small areas. However, for very large areas like entire continents, the slope is much steeper, ranging from 0.6 to 1.2.

**9. Concept Application:** Which of the following is an *In-situ* conservation measure?
   a) A tiger in a Zoo.
   b) A rare orchid in a Botanical Garden.
   c) A rhinoceros in Kaziranga National Park.
   d) Seeds in a seed bank.
**Answer:** c) A rhinoceros in Kaziranga National Park.
**Explanation:** In-situ means conserving the species in its *natural* habitat. National Parks protect species within their natural environment.

**10. Analyze the Trend:** Why are amphibians more vulnerable to extinction than birds or mammals?
    a) They are hunted more.
    b) They require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, making them sensitive to habitat fragmentation and pollution.
    c) They have a very long lifespan.
    d) They are at the top of the food chain.
**Answer:** b) They require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats...
**Explanation:** Amphibians have permeable skin (sensitive to pollution) and complex life cycles requiring both water and land. Degradation of *either* habitat affects them.

**11. Identify the Hotspot:** Which of the following regions in India is considered a "Biodiversity Hotspot"?
    a) The Thar Desert
    b) The Gangetic Plains
    c) The Western Ghats
    d) The Deccan Plateau
**Answer:** c) The Western Ghats
**Explanation:** Western Ghats (along with Sri Lanka), Himalayas, and Indo-Burma are the biodiversity hotspots covering India, characterized by high endemism and threat levels.

**12. Co-extinction Logic:** If a specific species of bee goes extinct, which of the following is the most likely immediate consequence?
    a) The honey production will increase.
    b) The specific plant species pollinated *only* by that bee will also face extinction.
    c) Other bees will immediately take over its role.
    d) The ecosystem will remain unaffected.
**Answer:** b) The specific plant species pollinated *only* by that bee will also face extinction.
**Explanation:** This is Co-extinction. In obligate mutualisms (like specific pollinator-plant pairs), the loss of one leads to the loss of the other.

**13. Global Conservation:** The historic "Earth Summit" held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 resulted in which major convention?
    a) Kyoto Protocol
    b) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
    c) Montreal Protocol
    d) Ramsar Convention
**Answer:** b) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
**Explanation:** The Earth Summit (UNCED) resulted in the CBD, committing nations to conserve biodiversity and share benefits equitably.

**14. Silent Crisis:** Which of the following is often called the "Lungs of the Planet"?
    a) The Himalayas
    b) The Western Ghats
    c) The Amazon Rainforest
    d) The Great Barrier Reef
**Answer:** c) The Amazon Rainforest
**Explanation:** The Amazon rainforest produces approx. 20% of the total oxygen in the earth's atmosphere through photosynthesis.

**15. Differentiation:** Genetic Diversity vs. Species Diversity.
    *   *Scenario:* A forest has 500 different types of trees. A single species of bacteria has 50 different strains.
    *   *Classification:*
    a) Forest = Genetic Diversity; Bacteria = Species Diversity.
    b) Forest = Species Diversity; Bacteria = Genetic Diversity.
    c) Both are Genetic Diversity.
    d) Both are Species Diversity.
**Answer:** b) Forest = Species Diversity; Bacteria = Genetic Diversity.
**Explanation:** 500 different *types* of trees refers to species richness (Species Diversity). 50 strains within a *single species* refers to variation in genes (Genetic Diversity).

## Section B: Case-Study & Source-Based Questions

### Case Study 1: The Evil Quartet
The "Evil Quartet" refers to the four major causes of biodiversity loss.
**Scenario:** A large patch of forest is cleared to plant Soya beans. This fragments the remaining forest. A road is built through the middle.

**16. Identify:** Which member of the "Evil Quartet" is primarily described here?
    a) Over-exploitation
    b) Habitat Loss and Fragmentation
    c) Alien Species Invasion
    d) Co-extinction
**Answer:** b) Habitat Loss and Fragmentation
**Explanation:** The scenario describes cutting down forest (Loss) and breaking it into pieces with roads/farms (Fragmentation).

**17. Impact Analysis:** Why does fragmentation specifically hurt animals like Elephants or Tigers?
    a) They cannot find food.
    b) They require large territories for migration and hunting, which are now broken.
    c) They are afraid of roads.
    d) The Soya beans are toxic to them.
**Answer:** b) They require large territories...
**Explanation:** Large mammals need vast areas for foraging and mating. Fragmentation restricts them to small islands of habitat, leading to inbreeding and resource scarcity.

**18. Secondary Effect:** The edge of the fragmented forest becomes drier and hotter. This "Edge Effect" will likely:
    a) Increase the population of deep-forest birds.
    b) Decrease the population of species adapted to the cool, dark forest interior.
    c) Have no effect.
    d) Increase biodiversity.
**Answer:** b) Decrease the population of species adapted to the cool, dark forest interior.
**Explanation:** Edge effects alter the microclimate. Species adapted to the stable, moist interior cannot survive the exposed, variable conditions at the edge.

### Case Study 2: Saving the Tiger
Project Tiger was launched in India to save the Bengal Tiger. Conservationists used a "Total Ecosystem Approach" rather than just breeding tigers in cages.

**19. Rationale:** Why conserve the entire forest to save the tiger?
    a) Because tigers need privacy.
    b) Because the tiger is at the top of the food chain; saving the forest saves the deer (prey) and the plants (producers) required to support the tiger.
    c) Because it is cheaper.
    d) Because tigers eat trees.
**Answer:** b) Because the tiger is at the top of the food chain...
**Explanation:** The tiger cannot survive without prey, and prey cannot survive without plants. The "Total Ecosystem Approach" ensures the entire food web is preserved.

**20. Classification:** Is "Project Tiger" an example of In-situ or Ex-situ conservation?
    a) In-situ
    b) Ex-situ
    c) Both
    d) Neither
**Answer:** a) In-situ
**Explanation:** Project Tiger focuses on protecting tigers within their natural habitats (Tiger Reserves), which is In-situ conservation.

**21. Umbrella Species:** The tiger is often called an "Umbrella Species". What does this mean?
    a) It protects other animals from rain.
    b) Protecting the tiger indirectly protects many other species that live in the same large habitat.
    c) It is the largest animal.
    d) It has a wide geographic range.
**Answer:** b) Protecting the tiger indirectly protects many other species...
**Explanation:** An umbrella species has large habitat requirements. By protecting enough land for the tiger, you essentially place an "umbrella" of protection over all the smaller organisms in that range.

### Case Study 3: The Medicinal Plant
The plant *Rauwolfia vomitoria* grows in different ranges of the Himalayas. Scientists found that the concentration of the active chemical **Reserpine** varies significantly between plants growing in different areas.

**22. Identify:** This variation in chemical concentration within the *same* species is an example of:
    a) Species Diversity
    b) Ecological Diversity
    c) Genetic Diversity
    d) Hybridization
**Answer:** c) Genetic Diversity
**Explanation:** Variation in traits (like chemical potency) within individuals of the same species is driven by genetic differences (alleles).

**23. Significance:** Why is this diversity important for the pharmaceutical industry?
    a) It allows them to select and breed strains with the highest potency of the drug.
    b) It makes the plant look prettier.
    c) It proves the plant is a weed.
    d) It reduces the cost of harvesting.
**Answer:** a) It allows them to select and breed strains with the highest potency of the drug.
**Explanation:** Genetic diversity provides the raw material. Industry can screen these varieties to find the most productive ones for medicine manufacturing.

**24. Conservation:** If this plant becomes endangered due to over-harvesting, what is the best immediate *Ex-situ* method to save its genetic material?
    a) Declare the Himalaya a National Park.
    b) Store seeds in a Seed Bank or use Tissue Culture.
    c) Stop using Reserpine.
    d) Plant more trees.
**Answer:** b) Store seeds in a Seed Bank or use Tissue Culture.
**Explanation:** Ex-situ means "off-site". Seed banks or tissue culture allow scientists to preserve the genes in a lab/controlled setting immediately, preventing total loss.

## Section C: Creating, Designing & Critical Thinking

**25. Designing a Conservation Plan:**
   You are the District Collector. A rare species of frog has been discovered in a local wetland that is being threatened by a housing project.
   *   **Strategy:** Propose a 3-step plan to save the frog *without* completely stopping development.
   *   **Legal Tool:** Which designation (Sanctuary/Reserve) would best protect the wetland?
   **Answer:**
   *   **Strategy:**
       1.  **Core Zone:** Designate the specific breeding ground of the frog as a "No-Go" zone.
       2.  **Buffer Zone:** Create a buffer around the wetland where only eco-friendly activities (parks, walking paths) are allowed, keeping housing at a distance.
       3.  **Regulation:** Mandate strict waste-water treatment for the housing project to ensure zero sewage discharge into the wetland.
   *   **Legal Tool:** "Conservation Reserve" or "Community Reserve" (if locally owned) or declaring it a "Biodiversity Heritage Site".

**26. Visualizing Data:**
   Draw a graph representing the **Species-Area Relationship**.
   *   *Axes:* X-axis (Area), Y-axis (Species Richness).
   *   *Curve:* Rectangular Hyperbola.
   *   *Task:* Add a dotted line showing the Log-Log relationship (Straight line). Label the equation $log S = log C + Z log A$.
   **Answer:** (Visual description)
   *   **X-axis:** Area (A)
   *   **Y-axis:** Species Richness (S)
   *   **Curve:** A curve starting from the origin and rising steeply, then flattening out (Rectangular Hyperbola $S=CA^Z$).
   *   **Straight Line:** A straight line cutting through the graph representing the logarithmic scale equation $log S = log C + Z log A$.

**27. Ethical Debate:**
   **Topic:** "We should bring back extinct animals (De-extinction) like the Woolly Mammoth using cloning."
   *   **Arguments:** Provide one argument **FOR** and one argument **AGAINST**.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Argument FOR:** It is a way to correct human mistakes (if we caused the extinction) and could restore lost ecological functions (e.g., mammoths maintaining tundra grasslands).
   *   **Argument AGAINST:** It consumes massive resources that should be spent on saving *currently* endangered species. Also, the habitat for the mammoth (the Ice Age steppe) no longer exists, so the animal would suffer.

**28. Scenario Analysis (Invasive Species):**
   **Scenario:** *Parthenium* (Carrot grass) has invaded agricultural lands in India.
   *   **Problem:** Why is it difficult to eradicate?
   *   **Solution:** Suggest a biological control method instead of chemical herbicides.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Problem:** It produces thousands of seeds, grows fast, and has no natural herbivores in India to eat it.
   *   **Solution:** Use a Biological Control Agent, such as the leaf-feeding beetle *Zygogramma bicolorata*, which specifically eats Parthenium without harming crops.

**29. Concept Mapping:**
   Create a concept map connecting: **Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services, Oxygen, Pollination, Flood Control, Aesthetic Value.**
   **Answer:**
   *   **Biodiversity** -> provides -> **Ecosystem Services**.
   *   **Ecosystem Services** includes:
       *   **Provisioning/Regulating:** Plants -> provide -> **Oxygen**.
       *   **Regulating:** Insects/Birds -> provide -> **Pollination**.
       *   **Regulating:** Wetlands/Forests -> provide -> **Flood Control**.
       *   **Cultural:** Diversity -> provides -> **Aesthetic Value** (Tourism/Peace).

**30. Critical Thinking:**
   "Biodiversity Hotspots cover less than 2% of the earth's land area but hold a massive proportion of the world's biodiversity."
   *   **Implication:** Why does this fact make Hotspots a top priority for conservation funding?
   **Answer:**
   *   **Implication:** It represents the most efficient use of limited conservation funds ("Maximum protection for minimum area"). By protecting just these small 2% areas, we can potentially save >50% of the world's terrestrial species. It is a high-return investment strategy for nature.

**31. Formulating a Hypothesis:**
   **Observation:** Species diversity decreases as we move from the equator to the poles (Latitudinal Gradient).
   *   **Hypothesis:** Propose two reasons why the Tropics are so rich in species.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Reason 1 (Energy):** Tropics receive more solar energy, leading to higher productivity (more food), which can support larger populations and more specialized niches.
   *   **Reason 2 (Stability):** Tropical environments have been stable for millions of years (no Ice Ages), allowing evolution and speciation to continue uninterrupted for a long time.
