# Competency-Based Question Bank: Human Health and Diseases

## Section A: Competency-Based Multiple Choice Questions (Application & Analysis)

**1. Diagnose the Patient:** A patient presents with sustained high fever (39°C - 40°C), stomach pain, constipation, headache, and loss of appetite. The doctor prescribes a Widal test. What is the most likely diagnosis if the test is positive?
   a) Malaria
   b) Pneumonia
   c) Typhoid
   d) Amoebiasis
**Answer:** c) Typhoid
**Explanation:** These are the classic clinical symptoms of *Salmonella typhi* infection. The Widal test is specifically used to diagnose Typhoid (Enteric fever).

**2. Analyze the Immune Response:** A person is infected with a virus. Which of the following innate immune responses will be the *first* line of defense to prevent the virus from infecting neighboring healthy cells?
   a) Production of IgG antibodies
   b) Secretion of Interferons
   c) Activation of Memory B-cells
   d) Release of Histamine
**Answer:** b) Secretion of Interferons
**Explanation:** Interferons are cytokine barriers produced by virus-infected cells. They signal neighboring uninfected cells to produce antiviral proteins, protecting them from the virus.

**3. Identify the Vector:** A sudden outbreak of a disease characterized by severe joint pain and high fever occurs in a town. The local health department finds high breeding of *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes. Which disease is this likely to be?
   a) Malaria
   b) Filariasis
   c) Chikungunya
   d) Typhoid
**Answer:** c) Chikungunya
**Explanation:** Severe, debilitating joint pain is the hallmark of Chikungunya. The *Aedes* mosquito is the primary vector for both Chikungunya and Dengue.

**4. Assertion (A):** The use of vaccines leads to the production of antibodies and memory cells.
   **Reason (R):** Vaccines introduce pre-formed antibodies into the body for immediate protection.
   a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
   b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
   c) A is true but R is false.
   d) A is false but R is true.
**Answer:** c) A is true but R is false.
**Explanation:** Vaccines introduce **Antigens** (weakened/killed pathogens), which trigger the body's own immune system to *make* antibodies and memory cells (Active Immunity). Introducing pre-formed antibodies is **Passive Immunity**.

**5. Predict the Outcome:** If a person's thymus gland is removed at birth (thymectomy), which part of their immune system will be most severely affected?
   a) Humoral Immunity only
   b) Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
   c) Innate Immunity
   d) Phagocytosis
**Answer:** b) Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
**Explanation:** The Thymus is where T-lymphocytes mature. T-cells are responsible for CMI. Without a thymus, T-cells cannot mature, leading to severe deficiency in CMI.

**6. Mechanism of Action:** How does the HIV virus specifically cause immunodeficiency in the host?
   a) By destroying red blood cells.
   b) By attacking the liver cells.
   c) By destroying Helper T-lymphocytes (TH cells).
   d) By inhibiting antibody production directly.
**Answer:** c) By destroying Helper T-lymphocytes (TH cells).
**Explanation:** HIV infects and kills TH cells (CD4+ cells). Since TH cells are needed to activate both B-cells (for antibodies) and Cytotoxic T-cells, their loss collapses the entire adaptive immune system.

**7. Evaluate the Drug:** Morphine is a very effective sedative and painkiller. However, it is strictly regulated. Why?
   a) It causes severe allergic reactions.
   b) It is ineffective in most patients.
   c) It has a high potential for addiction and abuse.
   d) It causes kidney failure immediately.
**Answer:** c) It has a high potential for addiction and abuse.
**Explanation:** Morphine is an opioid that provides euphoria and powerful pain relief, but it leads to rapid physiological and psychological dependence (addiction).

**8. Differentiate:** Which of the following features distinguishes a **Malignant** tumor from a **Benign** tumor?
   a) Uncontrolled cell division.
   b) Absence of contact inhibition.
   c) Metastasis.
   d) Presence of blood vessels.
**Answer:** c) Metastasis.
**Explanation:** Both tumor types show uncontrolled growth. Only malignant tumors have the ability to shed cells into the blood/lymph and start new tumors in distant organs (Metastasis).

**9. Immunology Application:** A newborn baby receives IgA antibodies from the mother's milk (colostrum). What type of immunity is this?
   a) Natural Active Immunity
   b) Artificial Active Immunity
   c) Natural Passive Immunity
   d) Artificial Passive Immunity
**Answer:** c) Natural Passive Immunity
**Explanation:** It is **Passive** because the baby is receiving ready-made antibodies. It is **Natural** because it occurs through a biological process (breastfeeding), not a medical procedure.

**10. Lifecycle Analysis:** In the life cycle of *Plasmodium*, where does sexual reproduction (fertilization) occur?
    a) In the human liver.
    b) In the human RBCs.
    c) In the mosquito's gut.
    d) In the mosquito's salivary glands.
**Answer:** c) In the mosquito's gut.
**Explanation:** Gametocytes are taken up by the mosquito from human blood. They mature and fertilize in the mosquito's gut, forming a zygote.

**11. Identify the Mismatch:**
    a) *Salmonella typhi* - Bacteria - Typhoid
    b) *Microsporum* - Fungi - Ringworm
    c) *Wuchereria bancrofti* - Protozoa - Filariasis
    d) *Rhinovirus* - Virus - Common Cold
**Answer:** c) *Wuchereria bancrofti* - Protozoa - Filariasis
**Explanation:** *Wuchereria bancrofti* is a **Helminth** (specifically a Nematode or roundworm), not a protozoan.

**12. Critical Thinking:** Why are organ transplant patients given immunosuppressant drugs like Cyclosporin-A?
    a) To prevent bacterial infection of the new organ.
    b) To suppress Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and prevent graft rejection.
    c) To stimulate antibody production.
    d) To reduce pain.
**Answer:** b) To suppress Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and prevent graft rejection.
**Explanation:** The recipient's T-cells recognize the transplanted organ as "non-self" and attack it (Cell-Mediated response). Immunosuppressants block this attack to allow the organ to survive.

**13. Diagnosis:** A child has an itchy, dry, scaly lesion on the scalp. The doctor advises not to share the child's comb or towel. What is the causative organism likely to be?
    a) *Ascaris*
    b) *Entamoeba*
    c) *Trichophyton*
    d) *Haemophilus*
**Answer:** c) *Trichophyton*
**Explanation:** These are the symptoms of Ringworm, which is a fungal infection caused by genera like *Microsporum*, *Trichophyton*, or *Epidermophyton*.

**14. Prevention Strategy:** To prevent the spread of Amoebiasis and Ascariasis, which public health measure is most effective?
    a) Use of mosquito nets.
    b) Improvement of sanitation and hygiene (fecal-oral route).
    c) Vaccination campaigns.
    d) Wearing masks.
**Answer:** b) Improvement of sanitation and hygiene.
**Explanation:** Both diseases are transmitted when food or water is contaminated by the feces of an infected person containing eggs (*Ascaris*) or cysts (*Entamoeba*).

**15. Concept Check:** What is the primary function of "Memory cells" in the immune system?
    a) To produce antibodies immediately upon first exposure.
    b) To engulf pathogens.
    c) To launch a faster and stronger secondary response upon re-exposure.
    d) To differentiate into T-cells.
**Answer:** c) To launch a faster and stronger secondary response...
**Explanation:** Memory cells persist after an infection. Upon a second encounter with the same pathogen, they recognize it instantly and multiply rapidly to eliminate it before symptoms develop.

## Section B: Case-Study & Source-Based Questions

### Case Study 1: The Recurring Fever
Mr. Kumar returned from a trip to a forest area. A few days later, he started experiencing high fever which recurred every 3 days (48-hour cycle), accompanied by severe chills and shivering. His blood report showed a lower than normal RBC count.

**16. Identify:** What disease is Mr. Kumar likely suffering from?
    a) Typhoid
    b) Malaria
    c) Dengue
    d) Pneumonia
**Answer:** b) Malaria
**Explanation:** Recurring cycles of chills and high fever are characteristic of Malaria. The forest trip suggests mosquito exposure.

**17. Analyze:** What causes the characteristic "chills and recurring fever"?
    a) Release of histamine by mast cells.
    b) Rupture of RBCs and release of the toxin **Hemozoin**.
    c) Bacterial toxins in the blood.
    d) The bite of the mosquito itself.
**Answer:** b) Rupture of RBCs and release of the toxin Hemozoin.
**Explanation:** When *Plasmodium* multiplies in RBCs, the cells eventually burst, releasing Hemozoin. This chemical triggers the massive inflammatory response (fever/chills).

**18. Prevention:** Which vector control measure would have best prevented this infection?
    a) Using Gambusia fish in ponds.
    b) Wearing a mask.
    c) Drinking boiled water.
    d) Avoiding crowded places.
**Answer:** a) Using Gambusia fish in ponds.
**Explanation:** *Gambusia* fish eat mosquito larvae. Since Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes (*Anopheles*), controlling the vector population prevents the disease.

### Case Study 2: The Mysterious Lump
A 50-year-old woman discovers a hard, painless lump in her breast. She ignores it for months. Later, she notices swelling in her armpit lymph nodes. A biopsy confirms breast cancer.

**19. Evaluate:** The fact that the cancer has reached the lymph nodes suggests which property of the tumor?
    a) It is Benign.
    b) Contact Inhibition.
    c) Metastasis.
    d)Differentiation.
**Answer:** c) Metastasis.
**Explanation:** Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from the primary site (breast) to other parts of the body (lymph nodes).

**20. Treatment:** Her doctor recommends a combination of Surgery, Radiotherapy, and Chemotherapy. How does **Chemotherapy** specifically work to kill cancer cells?
    a) It surgically removes the tissue.
    b) It burns the cells with radiation.
    c) It uses drugs to target and kill rapidly dividing cells.
    d) It activates the immune system.
**Answer:** c) It uses drugs to target and kill rapidly dividing cells.
**Explanation:** Chemotherapy drugs interfere with DNA replication or cell division. Since cancer cells divide very fast, they are killed preferentially.

**21. Side Effects:** Why might she experience hair loss and anemia during treatment?
    a) The cancer eats the hair follicles.
    b) Chemotherapy drugs affect *all* rapidly dividing cells, including hair roots and bone marrow.
    c) It is a symptom of breast cancer.
    d) Due to lack of appetite.
**Answer:** b) Chemotherapy drugs affect *all* rapidly dividing cells...
**Explanation:** Normal cells that divide fast (hair, skin, blood-forming bone marrow) are caught in the crossfire of chemotherapy, leading to hair loss and low RBC counts (anemia).

### Case Study 3: The Allergic Reaction
Little Rohan goes to a park to play. Suddenly, he starts sneezing violently, his eyes become watery, and he has difficulty breathing (wheezing). His mother gives him an anti-histamine tablet, and he feels better.

**22. Mechanism:** Which antibody isotype is responsible for triggering this reaction?
    a) IgG
    b) IgA
    c) IgM
    d) IgE
**Answer:** d) IgE
**Explanation:** IgE is the immunoglobulin produced in response to environmental allergens.

**23. Cellular Level:** Which cells released the chemicals (like Histamine) that caused these symptoms?
    a) Macrophages
    b) Mast Cells and Basophils
    c) Helper T-cells
    d) Red Blood Cells
**Answer:** b) Mast Cells and Basophils
**Explanation:** IgE binds to the surface of Mast cells. When the allergen (pollen) attaches to this IgE, the mast cell "degranulates," releasing Histamine and Serotonin.

**24. Critical Analysis:** Why did the anti-histamine work?
    a) It killed the pollen grains.
    b) It blocked the action of histamine on body tissues.
    c) It increased IgE production.
    d) It acted as a vaccine.
**Answer:** b) It blocked the action of histamine on body tissues.
**Explanation:** Histamine causes sneezing/inflammation. Anti-histamines block the histamine receptors, stopping the symptoms.

## Section C: Creating, Designing & Critical Thinking

**25. Designing a Campaign:**
   You are the Health Officer for a city facing a **Dengue** outbreak.
   *   **Task:** Design a "3-Point Action Plan" for the public to control the vector (*Aedes*).
   *   **Focus:** Breeding habits (clean water, daytime biter).
   *   **Slogan:** Create a catchy slogan for your campaign.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Action Plan:**
       1.  **Source Reduction:** Empty all flower pots, coolers, and old tires weekly to prevent stagnant water (breeding sites).
       2.  **Physical Protection:** Wear full-sleeved clothing and use mosquito repellent even during the day (since *Aedes* is a day-biter).
       3.  **Community Vigilance:** Install mesh on windows and support municipal fogging/larvicide spraying in neighborhoods.
   *   **Slogan:** "Dry it out, Clear the air – Keep Dengue far from here!"

**26. Visualizing Immunity:**
   Draw a flowchart or describe the sequence of events in the **Humoral Immune Response** when a pathogen enters the blood.
   **Answer:**
   1.  **Recognition:** Pathogen antigen is recognized by a B-cell.
   2.  **Activation:** B-cell is stimulated (usually with help from a Helper T-cell).
   3.  **Proliferation:** B-cell multiplies rapidly.
   4.  **Differentiation:** B-cells turn into **Plasma Cells** (which secrete antibodies) and **Memory Cells** (for future use).
   5.  **Elimination:** Antibodies bind to pathogens, marking them for destruction by phagocytes or neutralizing them.

**27. Formulating a Hypothesis:**
   **Observation:** HIV cases are higher in populations with high rates of drug abuse.
   *   **Question:** Is this solely due to behavioral factors?
   *   **Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis linking the mode of drug administration to the transmission of the virus.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Hypothesis:** The sharing of contaminated, non-sterile needles and syringes during intravenous (IV) drug use acts as a direct conduit for blood-to-blood transmission of HIV from an infected user to a healthy one. This bypasses all external barriers, leading to a high infection rate in this demographic.

**28. Debating Addiction:**
   **Topic:** "Addiction is a disease, not a choice."
   *   **Task:** Provide two scientific arguments supporting this statement and one social argument against stigmatizing addicts.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Scientific 1:** Chronic drug use causes physical changes in the brain's reward system (Dopamine pathway), making the brain "wired" to crave the drug for survival signals.
   *   **Scientific 2:** Addiction involves "Loss of Control" where neurobiological damage impairs the prefrontal cortex (the decision-making center), making it impossible for the person to stop by willpower alone.
   *   **Social Argument:** Stigmatizing addicts drives them into hiding and prevents them from seeking the medical/rehabilitation help they need, which only worsens the public health crisis.

**29. Scenario Analysis (Cancer):**
   Two patients have tumors. Patient A has a **Benign** lipoma. Patient B has a **Malignant** sarcoma.
   *   **Comparison:** Compare their prognosis and treatment urgency.
   **Answer:**
   *   **Patient A (Benign):** Prognosis is excellent. The tumor is slow-growing and localized. It does not spread. Treatment is simple surgical removal, and it rarely recurs.
   *   **Patient B (Malignant):** Condition is life-threatening. The tumor grows aggressively, invades tissues, and shows **Metastasis** (spreading to lungs/liver). Treatment must be immediate and multi-modal (Surgery + Radiation + Chemotherapy) to prevent total organ failure.

**30. Creating a Public Health Advisory:**
   Draft a short advisory for a high school notice board regarding **"Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse."**
   **Answer:**
   *   **ADVISORY:** "Choose Your Future, Not a Habit!"
   *   **Warning Signs:** Watch out for sudden academic decline, withdrawal from hobbies, unexplained mood swings, or loss of appetite.
   *   **Peer Pressure Tip:** If someone pressures you, remember that 'No' is a complete sentence. Surround yourself with friends who respect your goals. Seek help from a trusted teacher or counselor if you feel overwhelmed.

**31. Analyzing Data:**
   **Data:** A graph shows antibody levels in blood.
   *   *Curve A:* Rises slowly after 2 weeks of exposure, reaches a low peak.
   *   *Curve B:* Rises rapidly within 3 days of *second* exposure, reaches a very high peak.
   *   **Interpretation:** Which curve represents the "Secondary Immune Response"? Why is it faster and stronger?
   **Answer:**
   *   **Curve B** is the Secondary Immune Response.
   *   **Reason:** During the first exposure (Curve A), the body created **Memory B and T cells**. Upon the second exposure (Curve B), these memory cells immediately recognized the pathogen and launched a massive production of antibodies. This "Immunological Memory" ensures the response is faster, higher in magnitude, and more effective.
