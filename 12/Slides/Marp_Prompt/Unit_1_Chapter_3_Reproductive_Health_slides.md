# Reproductive Health

## Chapter 1.3

---

## Definition & Importance

*   **Definition:** Complete physical, mental, and social well-being in reproductive matters.
*   **Importance:**
    *   Responsible Parenthood
    *   Prevention of STDs
    *   Maternal and Child Health
    *   Population Control
    *   Awareness

---

## RCH Programs

*   **Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Programs:**
    *   Initiated by Govt. of India (1951).
    *   **Aim:** Create awareness, provide facilities for reproductively healthy society.
    *   **Objectives:** Awareness, safe practices, birth control, STD management, maternal/child care.

---

## Population Explosion

*   Rapid increase in human population.
*   **Causes:** Decline in death rates, high birth rates.
*   **Consequences:** Resource scarcity, poverty, unemployment, environmental degradation.

---

## Population Control Measures

*   **Motivational Measures:**
    *   Small family norms ("Hum Do Hamare Do").
    *   Incentives for smaller families.
    *   Raising marriageable age (female 18, male 21).
    *   Education on family planning.
*   **Contraceptive Methods:** (Next slides)

---

## Contraception

*   Methods to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
*   **Ideal Contraceptive:** User-friendly, available, effective, reversible, minimal side effects, no interference with sexual drive.

---

## Natural Contraceptive Methods

*   **Periodic Abstinence (Rhythm Method):** Avoid coitus during ovulation (Day 10-17). High failure.
*   **Coitus Interruptus (Withdrawal Method):** Male withdraws before ejaculation. High failure.
*   **Lactational Amenorrhea:** Absence of menstruation during intense lactation (up to 6 months). Suppresses ovulation.

---

## Artificial Contraceptive Methods

### Barrier Methods

*   Prevent physical meeting of sperm and ovum.
*   **Condoms:** Male/female sheaths. Prevent semen deposition, protect against STDs.
*   **Diaphragms, Cervical Caps, Volts:** Cover cervix, used with spermicides.

---

### Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

*   Inserted by doctors into uterus.
*   **Non-medicated:** (e.g., Lippes Loop) Increase sperm phagocytosis.
*   **Copper-releasing:** (e.g., CuT) Suppress sperm motility/fertilizing capacity.
*   **Hormone-releasing:** (e.g., Progestasert) Make uterus unsuitable for implantation, cervix hostile to sperm.

---

### Oral Contraceptives (Pills)

*   **Combined Pills:** Progestogen + estrogen. Taken daily for 21 days.
*   **Progestogen-only Pills (Mini-pills).**
*   **Mechanism:** Inhibit ovulation, implantation; alter cervical mucus.
*   **Saheli:** Non-steroidal, once a week, few side effects.

---

### Implants & Surgical Methods

*   **Implants:** Progestogen/estrogen combinations under skin. Long-term.
*   **Surgical Methods (Sterilization):** Terminal, highly effective, irreversible.
    *   **Vasectomy (Male):** Vas deferens cut/tied.
    *   **Tubectomy (Female):** Fallopian tube cut/tied.

---

## Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)

*   **Definition:** Intentional/voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term (induced abortion).
*   **Legal Status:** Legalized in India (1971) with strict conditions.
*   **Reasons:**
    *   Unwanted pregnancies (unprotected sex, contraceptive failure, rape).
    *   Risk to mother's life.
    *   Fetal abnormalities.
*   **Safety:** Safer in first trimester (up to 12 weeks).
*   **Misuse:** Illegal female foeticide.

---

## Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)

*   Also known as Venereal Diseases (VD) or Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI).
*   Transmitted through sexual contact.
*   **Common STDs:**
    *   **Bacterial:** Syphilis, Gonorrhoea, Chlamydiasis.
    *   **Viral:** Genital Herpes, Genital Warts, Hepatitis B, AIDS.
    *   **Protozoal:** Trichomoniasis.

---

## STD Symptoms & Complications

*   **Symptoms:** Often minor (itching, discharge, pain, swelling) or asymptomatic (especially females).
*   **Complications (if untreated):** PID, abortions, stillbirths, ectopic pregnancies, infertility, cancer.

---

## STD Prevention

*   Avoid sex with unknown/multiple partners (monogamy).
*   Use condoms.
*   Avoid sharing needles, razors, toothbrushes.
*   Early detection and treatment.
*   Awareness and education.

---

## Amniocentesis

*   Fetal sex determination and disorder detection test.
*   **Procedure:** Amniotic fluid withdrawn, fetal cells cultured, chromosomes analyzed.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Detect chromosomal abnormalities (Down's, Klinefelter's).
    *   Detect genetic disorders (haemophilia, sickle-cell anemia).
*   **Misuse:** Illegal female foeticide (banned in India).

---

## Infertility & ART

*   **Infertility:** Inability to conceive after 1-2 years unprotected cohabitation.
*   **Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):** Help infertile couples.

---

## Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)

### In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) - Test-tube Baby

*   Fertilization of ovum by sperm outside body (lab).
*   **Application:** Blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count.
*   Zygote/early embryo transferred.

---

### Embryo Transfer (ET)

*   **ZIFT (Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer):** Zygote/early embryo (up to 8 blastomeres) into fallopian tube.
*   **IUT (Intra Uterine Transfer):** Embryo (>8 blastomeres) into uterus.

---

### Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT)

*   Ovum collected from donor transferred into fallopian tube of female who cannot produce ova.
*   **Application:** For females who cannot produce ova but can provide suitable environment.

---

### Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)

*   Sperm directly injected into ovum in lab.
*   **Application:** Very low sperm count, inability to fertilize ovum.

---

### Artificial Insemination (AI)

*   Semen (husband/donor) artificially introduced into vagina/uterus.
*   **Application:** Low sperm count, inability to inseminate.
*   **IUI (Intra Uterine Insemination):** Semen directly into uterus.
