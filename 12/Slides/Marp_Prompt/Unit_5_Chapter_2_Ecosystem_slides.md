# Ecosystem

## Chapter 5.2

---

## Definition of Ecosystem

*   Functional unit of nature.
*   Living organisms (biotic) interact among themselves and with physical environment (abiotic).

---

## Types of Ecosystems

*   **Natural:**
    *   **Terrestrial:** Forests, grasslands, deserts.
    *   **Aquatic:** Ponds, lakes, rivers, oceans.
*   **Artificial (Man-made):** Crop fields, aquariums, gardens.

---

## Components of an Ecosystem

### Abiotic Components (Non-living)

*   **Climatic Factors:** Temperature, light, water, wind.
*   **Edaphic Factors:** Soil (pH, minerals).
*   **Inorganic Substances:** CO2, O2, N, water, P, Ca.
*   **Organic Substances:** Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, humus.

---

### Biotic Components (Living)

*   **Producers (Autotrophs):** Produce own food (e.g., green plants, algae).
*   **Consumers (Heterotrophs):** Depend on others for food.
    *   **Primary:** Herbivores.
    *   **Secondary:** Primary Carnivores.
    *   **Tertiary:** Secondary Carnivores.
    *   **Quaternary:** Tertiary Carnivores.
*   **Decomposers (Saprotrophs):** Break down dead organic matter (bacteria, fungi).

---

## Pond Ecosystem

*   Shallow, freshwater aquatic ecosystem.

---

### Pond Ecosystem Components

*   **Abiotic:** Water, Sunlight, Dissolved Oxygen, Inorganic Salts, Organic Substances, Temperature.
*   **Biotic:**
    *   **Producers:** Phytoplankton, Floating plants, Submerged plants, Marginal plants.
    *   **Consumers:** Zooplankton (primary), Small fish (secondary), Large fish/birds (tertiary).
    *   **Decomposers:** Bacteria and fungi at the bottom.

---

## Productivity

*   Rate of biomass production or energy accumulation.

---

### Primary Productivity

*   Rate at which producers synthesize organic matter.
*   **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP):** Total organic matter produced.
*   **Net Primary Productivity (NPP):** GPP - Respiration (R).
    *   `NPP = GPP - R`
    *   Available biomass for heterotrophs.
*   Units: g/m²/year or kcal/m²/year.

---

### Secondary Productivity

*   Rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers.
*   Rate of assimilation of food by consumers.

---

## Decomposition

*   Breakdown of complex organic matter (detritus) into simpler inorganic substances by decomposers.
*   Vital for nutrient cycling.

---

### Steps of Decomposition

1.  **Fragmentation:** Detritivores break detritus into smaller particles.
2.  **Leaching:** Water-soluble nutrients seep into soil.
3.  **Catabolism:** Microbial enzymes degrade detritus.
4.  **Humification:** Accumulation of humus (dark, amorphous, resistant).
5.  **Mineralization:** Humus degraded, releasing inorganic nutrients.

---

### Factors Affecting Decomposition

*   **Chemical Composition of Detritus:** Slower with lignin/chitin, quicker with nitrogen/sugars.
*   **Temperature:** Optimal (warm) favors.
*   **Moisture:** Adequate is essential.
*   **Aeration:** Oxygen required for aerobic decomposition.
*   **pH:** Neutral to slightly alkaline favorable.

---

## Energy Flow

*   Unidirectional, follows laws of thermodynamics.
*   Sun → Producers → Consumers.

---

### Food Chains

*   Sequence of organisms transferring energy by feeding.
*   **Grazing Food Chain (GFC):** Starts with producers.
    *   Example: Grass → Deer → Tiger.
*   **Detritus Food Chain (DFC):** Starts with dead organic matter.
    *   Example: Dead leaves → Fungi → Earthworm.
*   GFC major in aquatic, DFC major in terrestrial.

---

### Food Webs

*   Network of interconnected food chains.
*   More realistic, shows complex feeding relationships.

---

### Trophic Levels

*   Position an organism occupies in a food chain.
*   **TL 1:** Producers (Plants).
*   **TL 2:** Primary Consumers (Herbivores).
*   **TL 3:** Secondary Consumers (Primary Carnivores).
*   **TL 4:** Tertiary Consumers (Secondary Carnivores).
*   Decomposers occupy all levels.

---

## Ecological Pyramids

*   Graphical representation of relationships between trophic levels.
*   Base = Producers, Successive levels = Consumers.

---

### Pyramid of Energy

*   Always upright.
*   Represents total energy at each level.
*   Energy decreases by ~90% at each successive level (10% Law).

---

### Pyramid of Number

*   Number of individuals at each trophic level.
*   Can be upright, inverted, or spindle-shaped.
    *   **Upright:** Grassland (Grass > Grasshopper).
    *   **Inverted:** Parasitic (Single tree > Birds > Lice).
    *   **Spindle:** Forest (Trees < Deer > Fox).

---

### Pyramid of Biomass

*   Total dry weight (biomass) at each trophic level.
*   Can be upright or inverted.
    *   **Upright:** Most terrestrial (Producers > Herbivores).
    *   **Inverted:** Aquatic (Phytoplankton < Zooplankton).

---

## Key Concepts

### Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)

*   Wavelengths (400-700 nm) used by plants for photosynthesis.
*   Less than 50% of total solar radiation is PAR.
*   Plants capture 2-10% of PAR.

---

### 10% Law (Lindeman's Law)

*   Only ~10% of energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next.
*   Remaining 90% lost as heat or unconsumed.
*   Explains why food chains are short (max 4-5 levels).

---

### Standing Crop/State

*   **Standing Crop:** Amount of living biomass/number of organisms at a trophic level at a given time.
*   **Standing State:** Amount of inorganic nutrients in soil/water at a given time (nutrient pool).
