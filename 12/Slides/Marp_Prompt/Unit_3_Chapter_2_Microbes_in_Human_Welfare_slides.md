# Microbes in Human Welfare

## Chapter 3.2

---

## Microbes in Household Products

*   **Curd:**
    *   **Microbe:** *Lactobacillus* (Lactic Acid Bacteria - LAB).
    *   **Process:** LAB convert lactose to lactic acid, coagulating milk.
    *   **Benefits:** Increases Vitamin B12, checks disease-causing microbes.
*   **Bread:**
    *   **Microbe:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (Baker's yeast).
    *   **Process:** Yeast ferments sugars, produces CO2 (leavening).
*   **Cheese:**
    *   **Swiss Cheese:** *Propionibacterium shermanii* (large holes).
    *   **Roquefort Cheese:** Specific fungi (flavor).
*   **Dosa and Idli:** Dough fermented by bacteria.

---

## Microbes in Industrial Uses

*   Large-scale production in bioreactors.

---

### Fermented Beverages

*   **Microbe:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (Brewer's yeast).
*   **Products:** Ethanol, wine, beer, whisky, brandy, rum.
*   Wine and beer without distillation; others by distillation.

---

### Antibiotics

*   Chemicals produced by microbes that kill/retard other microbes.
*   **Penicillin:**
    *   **Discovery:** Alexander Fleming (1928) from *Penicillium notatum*.
    *   **Full Potential:** Ernst Chain and Howard Florey.
    *   **Uses:** Treat bacterial infections.

---

### Organic Acids

*   **Citric Acid:** *Aspergillus niger* (fungus).
*   **Acetic Acid:** *Acetobacter aceti* (bacterium).
*   **Butyric Acid:** *Clostridium butylicum* (bacterium).
*   **Lactic Acid:** *Lactobacillus* (bacterium).

---

### Enzymes

*   **Lipases:** In detergents (remove oily stains).
*   **Pectinases & Proteases:** Clear bottled fruit juices.
*   **Streptokinase:** From *Streptococcus*. Used as 'clot buster' (myocardial infarction).

---

### Bioactive Molecules

*   **Cyclosporin A:** From *Trichoderma polysporum* (fungus).
    *   **Use:** Immunosuppressive agent in organ transplant patients.
*   **Statins:** From *Monascus purpureus* (yeast).
    *   **Use:** Blood-cholesterol lowering agents.

---

## Microbes in Sewage Treatment

*   **Sewage:** Wastewater with organic matter and pathogens.
*   Treated in Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) using microbes.

---

### Primary Treatment (Physical)

*   Removes large and small particles.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Filtration:** Removes floating debris.
    2.  **Grit Removal:** Sedimentation of soil/pebbles.
*   Primary sludge settles, effluent goes to secondary treatment.

---

### Secondary Treatment (Biological)

*   Primary effluent in aeration tanks.
*   **Aeration:** Promotes growth of aerobic microbes (flocs).
*   **BOD Reduction:** Microbes consume organic matter, reducing Biochemical Oxygen Demand.
*   **Settling:** Flocs sediment (activated sludge).
*   **Inoculation:** Small part of activated sludge returned to aeration tank.
*   **Anaerobic Digestion:** Remaining sludge digested by anaerobic bacteria, producing biogas (methane, CO2, H2S).

---

## Microbes in Biogas Production

*   **Biogas:** Mixture of gases (mainly methane) from anaerobic breakdown of organic matter.
*   **Methanogens:** Anaerobic bacteria (e.g., *Methanobacterium*) produce methane.
    *   Found in sewage sludge, cattle rumen.
*   **Biogas Plant:** Concrete tank for bio-wastes, slurry, floating cover.
    *   Biogas used for cooking/lighting. Spent slurry as fertilizer.

---

## Microbes as Biocontrol Agents

*   Use of biological methods to control plant diseases/pests.
*   Reduces reliance on chemical pesticides.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Bt (*Bacillus thuringiensis*):** Controls insect pests (e.g., caterpillars). Toxin kills insects. (Used in Bt cotton).
    *   **Trichoderma:** Free-living fungus, controls plant pathogens.
    *   **Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV):** Species-specific insecticidal viruses. Do not harm non-target organisms.

---

## Microbes as Biofertilizers

*   Organisms that enrich soil nutrient quality.
*   **Bacteria:**
    *   **Rhizobium:** Symbiotic, fixes atmospheric nitrogen in legumes.
    *   **Azotobacter & Azospirillum:** Free-living, nitrogen-fixing.
*   **Cyanobacteria (Blue-green algae):**
    *   *Anabaena*, *Nostoc*. Fix atmospheric nitrogen, important in paddy fields.
*   **Mycorrhiza:** Symbiotic association of fungi with plant roots.
    *   Fungus absorbs phosphorus for plant.
    *   Provides disease resistance, drought tolerance, enhances growth.

---

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

*   Ecological approach combining various methods for pest control.
*   Minimizes economic damage and environmental risks.
*   **Alternatives to Chemical Pesticides:**
    *   Biocontrol agents (Bt, *Trichoderma*, NPV).
    *   Crop Rotation (breaks pest life cycles).
    *   Resistant Varieties.
    *   Biological Pesticides.
*   Promotes sustainable agriculture.
