# Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants

## Chapter 1.1

---

## Flower Structure

*   **Definition:** Reproductive organ of angiosperms.
*   **Parts:**
    *   **Calyx:** Sepals (protection)
    *   **Corolla:** Petals (attract pollinators)
    *   **Androecium:** Stamens (male, pollen)
    *   **Gynoecium:** Carpels (female, ovules)
*   **Components:** Ovary, Style, Stigma, Pedicel, Thalamus.

---

## Male Gametophyte

### Microsporangium (Pollen Sac) Structure

*   Located within the anther.
*   **Wall Layers:** Epidermis, Endothecium, Middle Layers, Tapetum (nutritive).
*   **Sporogenous Tissue:** Forms microspores.

---

### Microsporogenesis

*   Formation of microspores from Microspore Mother Cell (MMC) via **meiosis**.
*   MMC (2n) → Meiosis → Tetrad of haploid microspores (n).
*   Microspores develop into pollen grains.

---

### Pollen Grain Development

*   **Pollen Grain:** Represents the male gametophyte.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Exine:** Outer, sporopollenin (resistant), germ pores.
    *   **Intine:** Inner, pectocellulose.
    *   Cytoplasm, Nucleus.
*   **Development:** Mitotic division forms:
    *   **Vegetative cell:** Larger, forms pollen tube.
    *   **Generative cell:** Smaller, forms two male gametes.
*   Shed at 2-celled or 3-celled stage.

---

## Female Gametophyte

### Ovule (Megasporangium) Structure (Anatropous)

*   Develops into a seed after fertilization.
*   **Anatropous:** Inverted ovule, micropyle near funicle.
*   **Parts:**
    *   Funicle, Hilum, Raphe
    *   Integuments, Micropyle, Chalaza
    *   Nucellus (nutritive tissue)
    *   Embryo Sac (female gametophyte)

---

### Megasporogenesis

*   Formation of megaspores from Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) via **meiosis**.
*   MMC (2n) → Meiosis I & II → Linear tetrad of four haploid megaspores.
*   Typically, **three degenerate**, one functional megaspore remains.

---

### Embryo Sac Development (Monosporic)

*   Develops from a single functional megaspore.
*   **Three successive free nuclear mitotic divisions:**
    *   1-nucleate → 2-nucleate → 4-nucleate → 8-nucleate.
*   **Cell walls form:** Leads to 7-celled, 8-nucleate embryo sac.

---

### Embryo Sac Organization

*   **Micropylar end:**
    *   **Egg cell:** Female gamete.
    *   **Two Synergids:** With filiform apparatus (guides pollen tube).
*   **Chalazal end:**
    *   **Three Antipodal cells:** (Nutritive, often degenerate).
*   **Center:**
    *   **Large Central cell:** Contains two polar nuclei.

---

## Pollination

*   **Definition:** Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Autogamy:** Same flower (self-pollination).
        *   Cleistogamous (closed flowers)
        *   Chasmogamous (open flowers)
    *   **Geitonogamy:** Different flowers on same plant (genetically self, ecologically cross).
    *   **Xenogamy:** Different plants of same species (true cross-pollination).

---

## Agents of Pollination

*   **Abiotic (Non-living):**
    *   **Wind (Anemophily):** Small, inconspicuous flowers; light, non-sticky pollen; feathery stigmas (e.g., grasses).
    *   **Water (Hydrophily):** Rare; pollen protected by mucilage (e.g., *Vallisneria*).
*   **Biotic (Living):**
    *   **Insects (Entomophily):** Large, bright, fragrant flowers; nectar; sticky pollen (e.g., bees).
    *   **Animals (Zoophily):** Birds, bats, etc. (e.g., bird-pollinated: red, tubular).

---

## Outbreeding Devices

*   Mechanisms to discourage self-pollination and promote cross-pollination.
*   **Dichogamy:** Anthers & stigma mature at different times.
    *   Protandry (anthers first)
    *   Protogyny (stigma first)
*   **Herkogamy:** Physical barrier.
*   **Heterostyly:** Different style/stamen lengths.
*   **Self-incompatibility:** Genetic prevention of self-pollen germination.
*   **Unisexuality:** Male & female flowers separate.
    *   Monoecious (same plant)
    *   Dioecious (different plants)

---

## Pollen-Pistil Interaction

*   Sequence of events from pollen deposition to pollen tube entry into ovule.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Recognition:** Pistil identifies compatible pollen.
    2.  **Germination:** Pollen tube emerges from germ pore.
    3.  **Growth:** Pollen tube grows through stigma/style, guided by chemical signals.
    4.  **Entry into Ovule:** Typically through micropyle (porogamy).
    5.  **Entry into Embryo Sac:** Through synergid via filiform apparatus.
*   **Significance:** Ensures only compatible pollen leads to fertilization.

---

## Artificial Hybridization

*   Crop improvement program using desired pollen.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Emasculation:** Removal of anthers from bisexual flower bud to prevent self-pollination.
    2.  **Bagging:** Covering emasculated flowers to prevent unwanted pollen contamination.
    3.  **Rebagging:** After pollination, rebag until fruit develops.
*   For unisexual female flowers, emasculation is not needed.

---

## Double Fertilization

*   Unique to flowering plants: Both male gametes participate in fertilization.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Pollen tube releases two male gametes into synergid.
    2.  **Syngamy:** One male gamete fuses with **egg cell** → Diploid **Zygote** (2n).
    3.  **Triple Fusion:** Other male gamete fuses with **two polar nuclei** → Triploid **Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN)** (3n).
*   **Significance:**
    *   Forms zygote (embryo).
    *   Forms endosperm (nourishment for embryo).
    *   Characteristic feature of angiosperms.

---

## Post-Fertilization Events

*   **Ovary** → **Fruit**
*   **Ovules** → **Seeds**
*   **Zygote** → **Embryo**
*   **Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN)** → **Endosperm**

---

## Endosperm

*   Nutritive tissue for developing embryo.
*   **Types of Development:**
    *   **Nuclear:** Free nuclear divisions (e.g., coconut water).
    *   **Cellular:** Cell wall formation after each division (e.g., *Datura*).
    *   **Helobial:** Intermediate.

---

## Embryo Development (Embryogeny)

*   Development of embryo from zygote at micropylar end.
*   **Dicot Embryo:**
    *   Zygote → Suspensor cell & Embryonal cell.
    *   Proembryo → Globular → Heart-shaped → Mature embryo.
    *   Mature: Embryonal axis (plumule, radicle), two cotyledons.
*   **Monocot Embryo:**
    *   Zygote → Scutellum (single cotyledon).
    *   Mature: Scutellum, embryonal axis (plumule, radicle), coleoptile, coleorhiza.

---

## Seed Formation

*   Final product of sexual reproduction.
*   **Parts:**
    *   **Seed Coat:** From integuments (testa, tegmen).
    *   **Hilum:** Scar of funicle attachment.
    *   **Micropyle:** Pore for O2/water entry.
    *   **Embryo:** Embryonal axis + cotyledon(s).

---

## Fruit Types

*   **True Fruit:** Develops only from **ovary** (e.g., mango).
*   **False Fruit:** Develops from **ovary + other floral parts** (e.g., apple - thalamus).

---

## Albuminous vs. Non-Albuminous Seeds

*   **Albuminous (Endospermic):** Retain **endosperm** as nutritive tissue (e.g., wheat, castor).
*   **Non-Albuminous (Ex-albuminous):** No residual endosperm; food stored in **cotyledons** (e.g., pea, groundnut).

---

## Special Modes

### Apomixis

*   Asexual reproduction mimicking sexual, seeds formed **without fertilization**.
*   **Significance:** Perpetuates hybrid vigor in hybrid seed production.

---

### Parthenocarpy

*   Development of **fruit without fertilization**.
*   **Characteristics:** Typically **seedless** (e.g., banana, grapes).
*   Can be induced by hormones.

---

### Polyembryony

*   Occurrence of **more than one embryo in a single seed**.
*   **Causes:** Multiple embryo sacs, embryos from other cells, cleavage of proembryo.
*   **Examples:** *Citrus*, mango.

---

## Significance of Seed and Fruit Dispersal

*   **Seed Dispersal:** Movement of seeds away from parent plant.
    *   Prevents overcrowding.
    *   Colonizes new areas.
    *   Avoids pathogens/predators.
*   **Fruit Dispersal:** Movement of fruits (containing seeds).
    *   Protects seeds.
    *   Attracts dispersal agents.

---

## Agents of Dispersal

*   **Wind (Anemochory):** Light seeds, wings/hairs (e.g., dandelion).
*   **Water (Hydrochory):** Floating structures (e.g., coconut).
*   **Animals (Zoochory):**
    *   Epizoochory (attach to fur/feathers, e.g., *Xanthium*).
    *   Endozoochory (eaten, dispersed via faeces, e.g., berries).
*   **Explosive Mechanism (Autochory):** Fruits burst (e.g., pea).
*   **Gravity:** Heavy fruits fall.
