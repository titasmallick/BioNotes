# Organisms and Populations

## Chapter 5.1

---

## Definition of Population

*   Group of individuals of the same species.
*   Live in a well-defined geographical area.
*   Share/compete for resources, potentially interbreed.
*   **Example:** Teakwood trees in a forest.

---

## Population Attributes

*   Characteristics unique to populations, not individuals.

---

### Population Density

*   Number of individuals per unit area/volume.
*   **Formula:** D = N / S (or V).
*   Can be measured in relative terms (e.g., bird count on a tree).

---

### Sex Ratio

*   Ratio of males to females in a population.
*   Expressed as females per 1000 males (or vice versa).

---

### Natality (Birth Rate)

*   Number of births per thousand individuals per unit time.
*   Adds new individuals to population.

---

### Mortality (Death Rate)

*   Number of deaths per thousand individuals per unit time.
*   Decreases population size.

---

## Population Growth Models

*   Population size changes due to resources, predation, weather.
*   `dN/dt = (b + i) - (d + e)`
    *   `b` = birth rate, `i` = immigration
    *   `d` = death rate, `e` = emigration

---

### Exponential Growth Model

*   Occurs with unlimited resources.
*   J-shaped curve.
*   **Equation:** `dN/dt = rN`
    *   `r` = intrinsic rate of natural increase.
*   `Nt = N0 * e^(rt)`

---

### Logistic Growth Model

*   More realistic, occurs with limited resources.
*   S-shaped (Sigmoid) curve.
*   **Carrying Capacity (K):** Max population size environment can sustain.
*   **Equation:** `dN/dt = rN * ((K - N) / K)`
*   **Phases:** Lag, Log (exponential), Stationary.

---

### Age Pyramids (Age Distribution)

*   Proportion of individuals in different age groups.
*   **Age Groups:** Pre-reproductive, reproductive, post-reproductive.
*   **Shapes indicate growth status:**
    *   **Expanding (Triangular):** Growing population.
    *   **Stable (Bell-shaped):** Stable population.
    *   **Declining (Urn-shaped):** Declining population.

---

## Population Interactions

*   Species interact in various ways (beneficial, detrimental, neutral).

---

### Mutualism (+/+)

*   Both species benefit.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Lichens (fungus + algae/cyanobacteria).
    *   Mycorrhizae (fungi + plant roots).
    *   Pollination (animals get nectar, plants get pollinated).
    *   Fig and Wasp.
    *   Rhizobium in leguminous plants.

---

### Competition (-/-)

*   Both species harmed due to limited resources.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Interference:** Direct aggressive interaction.
    *   **Exploitative:** Indirect, one consumes shared resource.
*   **Competitive Exclusion Principle (Gause):** Two species cannot coexist if competing for same limited resources.
*   **Resource Partitioning:** Species avoid competition by using resources differently.

---

### Predation (+/-)

*   Predator kills and consumes prey.
*   **Importance:**
    *   Energy transfer.
    *   Keeps prey populations in check.
    *   Maintains species diversity.
*   **Prey Adaptations:**
    *   Camouflage, Mimicry, Chemical defenses, Thorns/Spines.

---

### Parasitism (+/-)

*   Parasite lives on/in host, derives nourishment, harms host.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Ectoparasites:** On external surface (lice, ticks).
    *   **Endoparasites:** Inside host body (tapeworm, Plasmodium).
    *   **Brood Parasitism:** Parasitic bird lays eggs in host nest (cuckoo).
*   **Parasite Adaptations:** Loss of organs, adhesive organs, high reproductive capacity.

---

### Commensalism (+/0)

*   One species benefits, other is neither harmed nor benefited.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Orchids on mango branch.
    *   Barnacles on whale.
    *   Cattle Egret and grazing cattle.
    *   Sea Anemone and Clownfish.

---

### Amensalism (-/0)

*   One species harmed, other unaffected.
*   **Examples:**
    *   *Penicillium* secretes penicillin (harms bacteria, *Penicillium* unaffected).
    *   Black walnut tree releases juglone (inhibits other plants).
