# Evolution

## Chapter 2.3

---

## Definition of Evolution

*   Gradual change in characteristics of a population over generations.
*   Leads to development of new species.
*   Slow, continuous, irreversible process.

---

## Origin of Life

*   **Abiogenesis (Spontaneous Generation):** Discredited theory (life from non-living).
*   **Biogenesis:** Life from pre-existing life.
*   **Oparin-Haldane Theory (Chemical Evolution):**
    *   Life originated from non-living organic molecules under primitive Earth conditions.
    *   Reducing atmosphere, high temp, UV, volcanic storms.

---

### Miller-Urey Experiment (1953)

*   Simulated primitive Earth conditions.
*   Observed formation of amino acids, sugars, nitrogenous bases.
*   Provided evidence for chemical evolution.

---

## Evidences of Evolution

### Morphological and Anatomical Evidences

*   **Homologous Organs:** Same structure, different function.
    *   Indicates divergent evolution (common ancestry).
    *   **Example:** Forelimbs of whale, bat, cheetah, human.
*   **Analogous Organs:** Different structure, same function.
    *   Indicates convergent evolution (similar adaptations).
    *   **Example:** Wings of insects and birds.

---

### Embryological Evidences

*   **Recapitulation Theory (Biogenetic Law - Haeckel):** "Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny."
    *   Developmental history repeats evolutionary history.
    *   **Example:** Vertebrate embryos show gill slits.
    *   (Criticized for extreme interpretation).

---

### Palaeontological Evidences

*   **Fossils:** Preserved remains of past organisms.
*   **Significance:** Direct evidence of life forms and evolutionary changes over time.
*   **Example:** Fossil records of horses (gradual size increase, toe reduction).

---

### Biogeographical Evidences

*   Study of species distribution across regions.
*   **Example:** Darwin's finches on Galapagos Islands (different beaks for different food sources).
*   **Adaptive Radiation:** Evolution of diverse species from a common ancestor in a given area.
    *   **Example:** Darwin's finches, Australian marsupials.

---

### Molecular Evidences

*   Similarities in DNA, RNA, protein sequences.
*   Closer relationship = more similarities.
*   **Example:** Human and chimpanzee DNA are 98% similar.

---

## Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection

*   Proposed by Charles Darwin (1859).
*   **Key Concepts:**
    1.  **Overproduction:** More offspring than can survive.
    2.  **Struggle for Existence:** Competition for resources.
    3.  **Variation:** Individuals show heritable variations.
    4.  **Survival of the Fittest (Natural Selection):** Advantageous variations lead to better survival/reproduction.
    5.  **Inheritance:** Favorable variations passed on.
    6.  **Speciation:** Accumulation of variations leads to new species.

---

## Neo-Darwinism (Modern Synthesis)

*   Combines Darwinian natural selection with Mendelian genetics.
*   Explains sources of variation.
*   **Factors:**
    *   **Mutation:** New variations.
    *   **Recombination:** Reshuffling of existing variations.
    *   **Natural Selection:** Differential survival.
    *   **Gene Flow:** Gene movement between populations.
    *   **Genetic Drift:** Random changes in allele frequencies (Founder Effect, Bottleneck Effect).

---

## Examples of Evolution

*   **Giraffe:** Natural selection favored longer necks for food access.
*   **Industrial Melanism:** Peppered moth (*Biston betularia*).
    *   Dark moths favored in polluted industrial areas due to camouflage.
*   **Antibiotic Resistance:** Bacteria evolve resistance due to natural selection in presence of antibiotics.

---

## Mutation Theory: Hugo de Vries

*   Evolution occurs through sudden, large, discontinuous changes called **mutations (saltation)**.
*   Contrasts with Darwin's gradual variations.
*   Emphasized mutations as raw material for evolution (now part of Neo-Darwinism).

---

## Hardy–Weinberg Principle

*   Allele and genotype frequencies remain constant in a large, randomly mating population, in absence of evolutionary influences.
*   **Equation:** `p² + 2pq + q² = 1`
    *   `p` = dominant allele freq, `q` = recessive allele freq.
*   **Factors causing evolution (deviations):** Gene migration, genetic drift, mutation, recombination, natural selection.

---

## Types of Natural Selection

1.  **Directional Selection:** Favors one extreme phenotype.
    *   **Example:** Industrial melanism.
2.  **Disruptive Selection:** Favors both extremes over intermediate.
    *   Can lead to speciation.
    *   **Example:** Finches with small/large beaks.
3.  **Stabilizing Selection:** Favors intermediate phenotypes, acts against extremes.
    *   Reduces variation.
    *   **Example:** Human birth weight.

---

## Adaptive Radiation

*   Evolution of different species from a common ancestor in a given geographical area.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Darwin’s Finches:** Diversified into various niches on Galapagos.
    *   **Australian Marsupials:** Evolved from common ancestor into diverse forms.

---

## Human Evolution

*   Evolutionary history from early primates to *Homo sapiens sapiens*.
*   **Key Stages:**
    *   **Dryopithecus:** Ape-like (15 mya).
    *   **Ramapithecus:** More man-like, upright (15 mya).
    *   **Australopithecus:** East African grasslands, stone weapons, upright (2 mya).
    *   **Homo habilis:** First human-like, 650-800 cc brain (2 mya).
    *   **Homo erectus:** 900 cc brain, ate meat, used fire (1.5 mya).
    *   **Neanderthal Man:** 1400 cc brain, buried dead (100,000-40,000 years ago).
    *   **Homo sapiens (Cro-Magnon):** Africa, 1450 cc brain, cave art (75,000-10,000 years ago).
    *   **Homo sapiens sapiens (Modern Man):** Agriculture, settled habitations (10,000 years ago).
