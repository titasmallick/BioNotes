# Biodiversity and Conservation

## Chapter 5.3

---

## Concept of Biodiversity

*   Variety of life on Earth at all levels (genes to ecosystems).
*   Term popularized by Edward Wilson.

---

## Types of Biodiversity

*   **Genetic Diversity:** Variation within a species.
    *   **Example:** *Rauwolfia vomitoria* (reserpine potency), 50,000 rice strains in India.
*   **Species Diversity:** Variety of species in a region.
    *   **Species Richness:** Number of species.
    *   **Species Evenness:** Relative abundance.
    *   **Example:** Western Ghats amphibian diversity > Eastern Ghats.
*   **Ecosystem Diversity:** Variety of ecosystems in an area.
    *   **Example:** India (deserts, rainforests, mangroves) > Norway.

---

## Patterns of Biodiversity

### Latitudinal Gradient

*   Species diversity decreases from equator to poles.
*   **Tropics** have more species due to:
    *   Stable climate (longer evolutionary time).
    *   Less seasonal variation (niche specialization).
    *   Higher productivity (more solar energy).

---

### Species-Area Curve

*   Proposed by Alexander von Humboldt.
*   Species richness increases with explored area, up to a limit.
*   **Equation:** `log S = log C + Z log A`
    *   `S` = Species richness, `A` = Area.
    *   `Z` = Slope (regression coefficient).
    *   `C` = Y-intercept.
*   On log scale, it's a straight line.
*   **Z value:** 0.1-0.2 for small areas, 0.6-1.2 for large areas.

---

## Importance of Biodiversity

### Utilitarian Reasons

*   **Direct:** Food, medicines (25% drugs from plants), industrial products (timber, fibers), ecotourism.
*   **Indirect (Ecosystem Services):** Pollination, pest control, climate regulation, nutrient cycling, water purification, soil formation.

---

### Ethical Reasons

*   Intrinsic value of every species.
*   Moral obligation to protect biological legacy for future generations.
*   All life forms have a right to exist.

---

### Rivet Popper Hypothesis

*   Proposed by Paul Ehrlich.
*   Ecosystem = airplane, species = rivets.
*   Loss of rivets (species) weakens the plane (ecosystem).
*   Loss of a "key" rivet (keystone species) can cause catastrophic collapse.
*   Every species plays a role in ecosystem health.

---

## Biodiversity Loss

*   Current extinction rates 100-1000 times faster than pre-human times.
*   **Examples of Extinct Species:** Dodo, Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger), Steller's Sea Cow, Quagga, 3 Tiger subspecies.

---

## Causes of Biodiversity Loss (The Evil Quartet)

1.  **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:**
    *   Most important cause.
    *   Destruction of natural habitats (deforestation, urbanization).
    *   Fragmentation affects species needing large territories.
    *   **Example:** Amazon rainforest clearing.

---

2.  **Over-exploitation:**
    *   Harvesting resources faster than they can replenish.
    *   **Examples:** Overfishing, overhunting (Steller's Sea Cow, Passenger Pigeon).

---

3.  **Alien Species Invasions:**
    *   Non-native species outcompete native ones.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Nile Perch in Lake Victoria (extinction of cichlid fish).
        *   Parthenium, Lantana, Eichhornia (invasive weeds).
        *   African Catfish (threat to indigenous catfish).

---

4.  **Co-extinctions and Co-evolution:**
    *   **Co-extinction:** Extinction of one species leads to extinction of associated species (e.g., host-parasite, plant-pollinator).
    *   **Co-evolution:** Reciprocal evolutionary influence between species.
        *   **Example:** *Ophrys* orchid and bees (sexual deceit).

---

## Biodiversity Conservation

### In Situ Conservation (On-site)

*   Conservation in natural habitats.
*   **Advantages:** Cost-effective, preserves entire ecosystem.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Biosphere Reserves:** Large protected areas for biodiversity and cultural diversity.
    *   **National Parks:** No human activity allowed.
    *   **Wildlife Sanctuaries:** Only wild animals protected, some human activity allowed.
    *   **Sacred Groves:** Protected by local communities due to beliefs.

---

### Ex Situ Conservation (Off-site)

*   Conservation outside natural habitats.
*   **Advantages:** Useful for endangered species, breeding programs.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Zoological Parks (Zoos), Botanical Gardens, Wildlife Safari Parks.**
    *   **Gene Banks/Seed Banks:** Store viable seeds, gametes, tissues (cryopreservation).
    *   **Cryopreservation:** Preservation at -196Â°C in liquid nitrogen.

---

## Other Important Concepts in Conservation

*   **Biodiversity Hotspots:** Regions with high species richness, endemism, and threat.
    *   36 worldwide, including Western Ghats/Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma, Himalaya in India.
*   **Ramsar Sites:** Wetlands of international importance (Ramsar Convention).
*   **Red Data Book:** IUCN catalog of threatened taxa.

---

## International Conventions

*   **Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro, 1992):**
    *   Called for biodiversity conservation and sustainable utilization.
    *   Led to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
*   **World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, 2002):**
    *   Pledged to reduce biodiversity loss rate.
