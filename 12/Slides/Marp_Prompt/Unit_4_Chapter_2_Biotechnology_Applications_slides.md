# Biotechnology Applications

## Chapter 4.2

---

## Health Applications

### Therapeutic Proteins (e.g., Insulin)

*   **Human Insulin (Humulin):** Produced using recombinant DNA technology in *E. coli*.
*   Avoids allergic reactions from animal insulin.

---

### Vaccines (Recombinant Vaccines)

*   Safer and more effective.
*   Genes for specific antigens inserted into harmless vectors.
*   **Example:** Hepatitis B vaccine (produced in yeast).

---

### Gene Therapy

*   Corrects gene defects by introducing functional genes.
*   **First Clinical Gene Therapy (1990):** For ADA deficiency (SCID).
*   Involves introducing functional ADA cDNA into lymphocytes.

---

### Stem Cell Technology

*   **Stem Cells:** Undifferentiated cells that self-renew and differentiate.
*   **Applications:** Regenerative medicine, drug discovery, disease modeling.
*   **Types:** Embryonic, adult, induced pluripotent (iPSCs).

---

### Molecular Diagnosis

*   Early and accurate disease diagnosis.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **PCR:** Detects low concentrations of pathogens/mutations by amplifying nucleic acids (e.g., HIV, cancer).
    *   **ELISA:** Detects antigens or antibodies based on antigen-antibody interaction (e.g., AIDS, typhoid).

---

## Agricultural Applications

### Genetically Modified (GM) Crops

*   Plants with altered genes for new traits.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Stress tolerance (cold, drought, salt).
    *   Reduced pesticide reliance.
    *   Reduced post-harvest losses.
    *   Increased mineral usage efficiency.
    *   Enhanced nutritional value.

---

### Pest-Resistant Crops

*   **Bt Cotton:** Contains genes from *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) producing toxins against insects.
*   **RNA interference (RNAi):** Silences specific nematode genes in plants (e.g., tobacco against *Meloidogyne incognita*).

---

### Biofortification

*   Breeding crops with higher levels of vitamins, minerals, or proteins.
*   **Golden Rice:** GM rice with beta-carotene (Vitamin A precursor) to combat deficiency.

---

## Transgenic Animals

*   Animals with foreign genes inserted into their DNA.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Study gene regulation and development.
    *   Disease models (cancer, Alzheimer's).
    *   Produce biological products (e.g., human proteins in milk).
        *   **Example:** Transgenic cow Rosie (human alpha-lactalbumin in milk).
    *   Vaccine safety testing.
    *   Chemical safety testing.

---

## Biosafety Issues

*   Concerns with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
*   **Ecological Risks:** Gene flow to wild relatives, impact on non-target organisms, biodiversity loss.
*   **Health Risks:** Allergenicity/toxicity in GM foods, antibiotic resistance.
*   **Ethical Concerns:** Moral objections, long-term effects.

---

### GEAC (Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee)

*   Indian government body.
*   Evaluates GM research and safety of GM organisms for public use.

---

## Biopiracy and Biopatents

*   **Biopiracy:** Unauthorized appropriation of traditional knowledge/genetic resources without compensation/permission.
*   **Biopatents:** Patents granted for biological entities/products.
    *   Microorganism strains, cell lines, GMOs, DNA sequences, biotechnological processes.

---

### Examples of Biopiracy

*   **Turmeric:** US patent for wound-healing properties (revoked after India's evidence).
*   **Basmati Rice:** US company patented a new variety (hybrid of Indian Basmati), later narrowed.
*   Highlights need for protection of traditional knowledge and equitable benefit sharing.
