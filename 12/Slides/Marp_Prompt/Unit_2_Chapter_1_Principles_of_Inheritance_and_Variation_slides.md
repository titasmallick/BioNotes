# Principles of Inheritance and Variation

## Chapter 2.1

---

## Heredity and Variation

*   **Heredity:** Passing of traits from parent to progeny.
*   **Variation:** Differences between progeny and parents.
    *   Arises from crossing over, mutation, recombination, environment.

---

## Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance

*   Gregor Johann Mendel: "Father of Genetics."
*   Experiments on garden peas (*Pisum sativum*).

---

### Monohybrid Cross

*   Involves a single pair of contrasting characters.
*   **Law of Dominance:** In heterozygotes, dominant allele expresses, recessive is unexpressed.
*   **Law of Segregation:** Alleles separate during gamete formation; each gamete gets one allele.

---

### Dihybrid Cross

*   Involves two pairs of contrasting characters.
*   **Law of Independent Assortment:** Segregation of one character pair is independent of another.
    *   Applies to genes on different chromosomes or far apart on same chromosome.

---

### Genetic Crosses

*   **Back Cross:** F1 hybrid x any parent.
*   **Test Cross:** F1 hybrid x recessive parent.
    *   Used to determine genotype of dominant phenotype.
*   **Punnett Square:** Graphical tool for calculating offspring probabilities.

---

## Key Genetic Terms

*   **Gene:** Unit of inheritance, DNA segment coding for a trait.
*   **Allele:** Alternative forms of a gene (e.g., T, t).
*   **Homozygous:** Identical alleles (TT, tt).
*   **Heterozygous:** Different alleles (Tt).
*   **Dominant Allele:** Expresses phenotype even with recessive allele.
*   **Recessive Allele:** Expresses phenotype only in homozygous state.
*   **Genotype:** Genetic constitution (TT, Tt, tt).
*   **Phenotype:** Observable characteristics (Tall, Dwarf).

---

## Deviations from Mendelian Inheritance

### Incomplete Dominance

*   Neither allele completely dominant.
*   Heterozygote shows intermediate phenotype.
*   **Example:** Snapdragon flower color (Red x White → Pink).
*   F2 ratio: 1:2:1 (Red:Pink:White) for both phenotype and genotype.

---

### Codominance

*   Both alleles express fully in heterozygote.
*   **Example:** ABO blood group in humans.
    *   I^A and I^B are codominant.
    *   I^A I^B genotype → AB blood group.

---

### Multiple Alleles

*   More than two alleles for a single gene in a population.
*   **Example:** ABO blood group (I^A, I^B, i).

---

### Polygenic Inheritance

*   Trait controlled by three or more genes.
*   Additive effect of multiple genes.
*   **Example:** Human skin color, height.

---

### Pleiotropy

*   A single gene affects multiple phenotypic traits.
*   **Example:**
    *   Phenylketonuria (PKU): Single gene mutation affects mental development, pigmentation.
    *   Pea seed starch synthesis: Controls seed shape and starch grain size.

---

## Pedigree Analysis

*   Study of inheritance patterns in families over generations.
*   Uses standardized symbols.
*   Determines mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant/recessive, X-linked).

---

## Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

*   Proposed by Sutton and Boveri (1902).
*   Genes are located on chromosomes.
*   Chromosomes occur in pairs, segregate during meiosis.
*   Segregation of chromosomes leads to segregation of genes.

---

## Sex Determination

*   Mechanism determining an individual's sex.
*   **Humans (XY type):**
    *   Males (XY) produce X and Y sperm.
    *   Females (XX) produce only X eggs.
    *   Sperm determines sex.
*   **Birds (ZW type):**
    *   Females (ZW) produce Z and W eggs.
    *   Males (ZZ) produce only Z sperm.
    *   Egg determines sex.

---

### Other Sex Determination

*   **Honeybee (Haplodiploidy):**
    *   Males (haploid, n) from unfertilized eggs.
    *   Females (diploid, 2n) from fertilized eggs.
*   **Grasshopper (XO type):**
    *   Males (XO), Females (XX).
    *   Sperm determines sex.

---

## Linkage and Crossing Over

*   **Linkage:** Genes on same chromosome inherited together.
    *   Discovered by T.H. Morgan (*Drosophila*).
*   **Crossing Over:** Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
    *   Leads to recombination.
    *   Frequency proportional to distance between genes (used for genetic mapping).

---

## Mutation

*   Sudden heritable change in DNA sequence.
*   **Spontaneous:** Errors during replication/repair.
*   **Induced:** Caused by mutagens (physical, chemical, biological).
*   **Point Mutations:** Change in single base pair.
    *   Transition, Transversion.
*   **Frameshift Mutations:** Insertions/deletions altering reading frame.

---

## Sex-linked Inheritance

*   Inheritance of genes on sex chromosomes (X or Y).
*   **In Humans:**
    *   **Haemophilia:** X-linked recessive, prolonged bleeding.
    *   **Colour Blindness:** X-linked recessive, difficulty distinguishing colors (red/green).

---

## Mendelian Disorders

*   Caused by single gene alteration/mutation.
*   **Thalassemia:** Autosomal recessive, reduced globin synthesis, anemia.
*   **Sickle-cell Anaemia:** Autosomal recessive, point mutation, sickle-shaped RBCs.
*   **Phenylketonuria (PKU):** Autosomal recessive, metabolic disorder, mental retardation.

---

## Chromosomal Disorders

*   Caused by absence, excess, or abnormal arrangement of chromosomes.
*   **Down’s Syndrome (Trisomy 21):** Extra copy of chromosome 21 (47, XX/XY, +21).
    *   Mental retardation, short stature, characteristic facial features.
*   **Turner’s Syndrome (XO):** Absence of one X chromosome in females (45, XO).
    *   Sterile females, rudimentary ovaries.
*   **Klinefelter’s Syndrome (XXY):** Extra X chromosome in males (47, XXY).
    *   Masculine development with feminine features (gynecomastia), sterile males.
