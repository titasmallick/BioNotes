# Biotechnology Principles and Processes

## Chapter 4.1

---

## Definition of Biotechnology

*   Use of living organisms/products to create/modify products, improve plants/animals, or develop microorganisms.
*   EFB: Integration of natural science and organisms/cells/parts for products/services.

---

## Core Principles of Modern Biotechnology

1.  **Genetic Engineering:** Altering genetic material (DNA/RNA) to change host phenotype.
2.  **Bioprocess Engineering:** Maintaining sterile environment for large-scale growth of desired microbes/cells.

---

## Genetic Engineering: Recombinant DNA (rDNA) Technology

*   Manipulation of genetic material to achieve desired traits.
*   Creation of new DNA molecules by combining genetic material from different sources.

---

### Key Components of rDNA Technology

*   **Restriction Enzymes:** Molecular scissors (cut DNA).
*   **Cloning Vector:** DNA molecule carrying foreign DNA, replicates independently.
*   **Desired Gene (Foreign DNA/Insert DNA):** Gene of interest.
*   **Host Organism:** Receives rDNA for replication/expression.

---

## Steps of Recombinant DNA Technology

1.  **Isolation of Genetic Material (DNA):**
    *   Break open cells (enzymes: lysozyme, cellulase, chitinase).
    *   Remove RNA, proteins, etc.
    *   Precipitate DNA with chilled ethanol.

---

2.  **Cutting DNA at Specific Locations:**
    *   **Restriction Enzymes (Restriction Endonucleases):** Recognize and cut specific palindromic sequences.
    *   **Example:** EcoRI (cuts GAATTC), HindII.
    *   Foreign DNA and vector DNA cut with *same* enzyme for compatible sticky ends.

---

3.  **Amplification of Gene of Interest (PCR):**
    *   **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Synthesize multiple copies of gene *in vitro*.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Denaturation:** Separate DNA strands by heating.
        *   **Annealing:** Primers bind to strands.
        *   **Extension:** *Taq* polymerase synthesizes new DNA.
    *   Exponential amplification.

---

4.  **Ligation of DNA Fragments into a Vector:**
    *   Cut gene of interest + cut vector DNA.
    *   **DNA Ligase:** Joins sticky ends, forming recombinant DNA (rDNA).

---

5.  **Insertion of Recombinant DNA into Host Cell:**
    *   **Methods (Transformation):**
        *   **Heat Shock:** Treat cells with divalent cations (e.g., CaCl2), heat shock.
        *   **Microinjection:** Direct injection into animal cell nucleus.
        *   **Biolistics (Gene Gun):** Bombard cells with DNA-coated micro-particles (plants).
        *   **Disarmed Pathogen Vectors:** Use non-pathogenic *Agrobacterium* (plants), retroviruses (animals).

---

6.  **Selection and Screening of Transformed Host Cells:**
    *   Identify cells that took up rDNA.
    *   **Antibiotic Resistance Markers:** Transformed cells grow on antibiotic media.
    *   **Blue-White Screening:** Detects insertional inactivation of *lacZ* gene (blue = non-recombinant, white = recombinant).

---

7.  **Obtaining Foreign Gene Product (Cloning and Expression):**
    *   Express foreign gene to produce desired protein.
    *   **Cloning:** Making multiple identical copies.
    *   Optimize conditions (media, temp, pH) for high protein production.

---

## Bioreactors

*   Large vessels (100-1000 L) for large-scale production.
*   Provide optimal conditions for cell growth and product synthesis.

---

### Stirred-Tank Bioreactors

*   Most common type.
*   **Features:**
    *   Stirrer system (uniform mixing, oxygen availability).
    *   Oxygen delivery system.
    *   Foam control, temperature control, pH control.
    *   Sampling ports.

---

### Sparged Stirred-Tank Bioreactors

*   Air/gas bubbled (sparged) through reactor.
*   Increases surface area for oxygen transfer.
*   Stirring aids mixing and oxygen distribution.

---

## Downstream Processing

*   Separation and purification of desired product from bioreactor culture.
*   Critical step after biosynthesis.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Separation:** Product from cell culture (centrifugation, filtration).
    2.  **Purification:** Using various techniques (chromatography, electrophoresis).
    3.  **Formulation:** With preservatives.
    4.  **Quality Control Testing:** Purity, safety, efficacy.
    5.  **Clinical Trials (for drugs).**
*   Varies for each product.
