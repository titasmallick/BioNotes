# Molecular Basis of Inheritance

## Chapter 2.2

## Search for Genetic Material

### Griffith's Experiment (1928)

*   **Organism:** *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (R & S strains).
*   **Observation:** Heat-killed S strain transformed live R strain into S strain.
*   **Conclusion:** Proposed a "transforming principle."

---

### Avery, MacLeod, McCarty (1933-1944)

*   **Experiment:** Treated S strain extract with proteases, RNases, DNases.
*   **Observation:** Transformation inhibited only when DNA was digested.
*   **Conclusion:** DNA is the genetic material.

---

### Hershey-Chase Experiment (1952)

*   **Organism:** Bacteriophages and *E. coli*.
*   **Method:** Labeled DNA (³²P) and protein (³⁵S) of phages.
*   **Observation:** Only ³²P (DNA) entered bacterial cells and was found in progeny phages.
*   **Conclusion:** DNA, not protein, is the genetic material.

---

## DNA Structure

### Watson & Crick Model (1953)

*   Double helix structure.
*   Two polynucleotide chains, anti-parallel polarity.
*   Sugar-phosphate backbone, bases project inwards.
*   **Base Pairing:** A=T (2 H-bonds), G≡C (3 H-bonds).
*   Right-handed helix, 3.4 nm pitch, 10 bp/turn.

---

### Chargaff’s Rule

*   In DNA:
    *   Amount of A = Amount of T (A=T).
    *   Amount of G = Amount of C (G=C).
    *   (A+G) / (T+C) = 1.

---

## RNA Structure

*   Polymer of ribonucleotides, generally single-stranded.
*   **Types:**
    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries genetic info from DNA to ribosomes.
    *   **tRNA (transfer RNA):** Adaptor molecule, carries amino acids to ribosome.
    *   **rRNA (ribosomal RNA):** Structural and catalytic component of ribosomes.
    *   **hnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear RNA):** Eukaryotic primary transcript (introns & exons).
    *   **snRNA (small nuclear RNA):** Involved in splicing.

## Differences between DNA and RNA

| Feature | DNA | RNA |
|---|---|---|
| **Sugar** | Deoxyribose | Ribose |
| **Bases** | A, G, C, T | A, G, C, U |
| **Strands** | Double-stranded | Single-stranded (mostly) |
| **Function** | Genetic material | Protein synthesis, some genetic material |
| **Stability** | More stable | Less stable |

---

## DNA Packaging: Nucleosome

*   Basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes.
*   DNA wound around a core of eight histone proteins (histone octamer).
*   H1 histone is a linker.
*   Forms "beads-on-string" structure (chromatin).

---

## Central Dogma

*   Proposed by Francis Crick.
*   Genetic information flows: DNA → RNA → Protein.
    *   `DNA (Replication) → DNA (Transcription) → RNA (Translation) → Protein`

---

## Reverse Transcription

*   In retroviruses (e.g., HIV).
*   RNA acts as a template to synthesize DNA.
    *   `RNA → DNA (Reverse Transcription) → RNA → Protein`
*   Catalyzed by **reverse transcriptase**.

---

## DNA Replication

*   Process of making an exact copy of DNA.
*   **Semi-conservative:** Each new DNA has one original and one new strand.
    *   Proven by Meselson and Stahl Experiment.

---

### Enzymes in DNA Replication

*   **DNA Helicase:** Unwinds DNA.
*   **DNA Polymerase:** Synthesizes new strands (5'→3').
*   **DNA Ligase:** Joins Okazaki fragments.
*   **Primase:** Synthesizes RNA primers.
*   **Topoisomerase:** Relieves supercoiling.

---

## Transcription

*   Synthesizing RNA from a DNA template.
*   **In Eukaryotes:** Occurs in nucleus, involves RNA polymerase.
*   Primary transcript is **hnRNA** (contains introns and exons).

---

### Post-transcriptional Processing (hnRNA to mRNA)

1.  **Splicing:** Introns removed, exons ligated.
2.  **Capping:** Methyl guanosine triphosphate added to 5'-end.
3.  **Tailing:** Adenylate residues added to 3'-end.
*   Processed mRNA transported out of nucleus.

---

## Genetic Code

*   Sequence of nucleotides in mRNA specifying amino acid sequence.
*   **Codon:** Three consecutive nucleotides coding for an amino acid or stop signal.
*   **Features:**
    *   Triplet Code, Degenerate, Unambiguous, Universal, Non-overlapping, Comma-less.
    *   **Start Codon:** AUG (Methionine).
    *   **Stop Codons:** UAA, UAG, UGA.

---

## Translation (in Prokaryotes)

*   Synthesizing protein from mRNA template.
*   **Initiation:** Ribosome binds to mRNA, initiator tRNA binds to AUG.
*   **Elongation:** Amino acids added, peptide bonds form, ribosome translocates.
*   **Termination:** Stop codon reached, release factors bind, polypeptide released.

---

## Gene Expression: Lac Operon

*   Example of inducible operon in *E. coli* (lactose metabolism).
*   **Components:** Promoter, Operator, Structural Genes (*lacZ, lacY, lacA*), Regulator Gene (*i gene*).
*   **Lactose Absent:** Repressor binds to operator, operon OFF.
*   **Lactose Present:** Lactose (inducer) binds to repressor, operon ON.

---

## Human Genome Project (HGP)

*   International project to sequence human DNA and identify genes.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Identify all human genes (20,000-25,000).
    *   Sequence 3 billion base pairs.
    *   Store info in databases.
    *   Improve data analysis tools.
    *   Address ELSI (Ethical, Legal, Social Issues).

    *   Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs): Identify expressed genes.
    *   Sequence Annotation: Sequence entire genome, assign functions.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Understanding human biology/disease.
    *   Diagnosis, treatment, prevention of genetic disorders.
    *   Gene therapy, pharmacogenomics, forensic science.

## DNA Fingerprinting

*   Identifies individuals based on unique DNA patterns.
*   **Principle:** Based on Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs).
