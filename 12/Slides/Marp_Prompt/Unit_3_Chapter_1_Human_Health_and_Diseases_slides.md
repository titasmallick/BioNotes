---

## Immunity

*   Ability to fight disease, conferred by immune system.

---

### Innate Immunity (Non-specific)

*   Present from birth, general defense.
*   **Barriers:**
    *   **Physical:** Skin, mucus.
    *   **Physiological:** Acid (stomach), saliva, tears.
    *   **Cellular:** Phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages), NK cells.
    *   **Cytokine:** Interferons (protect non-infected cells).

---

### Acquired Immunity (Adaptive/Specific)

*   Pathogen-specific, develops after exposure, has memory.
*   **Active Immunity:** Host produces antibodies.
    *   Natural (infection), Artificial (vaccination).
*   **Passive Immunity:** Ready-made antibodies given.
    *   Natural (mother to fetus/infant), Artificial (antivenom).

---

### Types of Acquired Immunity

*   **Humoral Immunity (Antibody-Mediated - AMI):**
    *   Mediated by B-lymphocytes (B-cells).
    *   Produce antibodies circulating in blood/lymph.
*   **Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI):**
    *   Mediated by T-lymphocytes (T-cells).
    *   Directly attack infected cells, responsible for graft rejection.

---

## Antibodies (Immunoglobulins - Igs)

*   Protein molecules produced by B-cells in response to antigens.
*   **Structure:** Y-shaped, 2 light (L) chains, 2 heavy (H) chains.
    *   Variable region (antigen-binding), Constant region.
*   **Types:**
    *   **IgG:** Most abundant, crosses placenta.
    *   **IgA:** In secretions (colostrum, tears).
    *   **IgM:** Largest, first in primary response.
    *   **IgD:** On B-cell surface.
    *   **IgE:** Allergic reactions, anti-parasite.

---

## Immunisation & Vaccines

*   **Immunisation:** Process of making body immune (via vaccination).
*   **Vaccines:** Biological preparations providing active acquired immunity.
    *   Contain weakened/inactivated pathogens or antigens.
    *   Stimulate antibody/memory cell production without causing disease.
*   **Principle:** Immune system's 'memory'.

---

## AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome)

*   Caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), a retrovirus.
*   **Transmission:** Sexual contact, contaminated blood, shared needles, mother to child.
*   **Diagnosis:** ELISA test (confirmatory: Western blot).

---

### HIV Replication

1.  HIV infects helper T-lymphocytes (T-cells).
2.  Viral RNA â†’ viral DNA (reverse transcriptase).
3.  Viral DNA integrates into host DNA.
4.  Infected cell produces new viral particles.
5.  New viruses infect more T-cells, leading to immunodeficiency.

---

### AIDS Prevention

*   Avoid sexual contact with unknown partners, use condoms.
*   Avoid sharing needles.
*   Screen blood before transfusion.
*   Avoid drug abuse.
*   Public awareness.

---

## Cancer

*   Abnormal, uncontrolled cell proliferation.
*   Can invade and spread (metastasis).
*   **Benign Tumors:** Confined, less harmful.
*   **Malignant Tumors:** Cancerous, grow rapidly, metastasize.

---

### Causes of Cancer (Carcinogens)

*   **Physical:** Ionizing (X-rays), non-ionizing (UV).
*   **Chemical:** Tobacco smoke, asbestos.
*   **Biological:** Oncogenic viruses (HPV), certain parasites.
*   **Oncogenes:** Activated proto-oncogenes.

---

### Cancer Diagnosis & Treatment

*   **Diagnosis:** Biopsy, Histopathology, Radiography (X-rays, CT, MRI), Blood/Bone Marrow tests, Molecular techniques.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Surgery:** Tumor removal.
    *   **Radiotherapy:** Irradiation of cancer cells.
    *   **Chemotherapy:** Drugs to kill cancer cells.
    *   **Immunotherapy:** Biological response modifiers (e.g., alpha-interferon).

---

## Allergies

*   Exaggerated immune response to environmental antigens.
*   **Causes (Allergens):** Pollen, dust mites, animal dander, foods, drugs.
*   **Mechanism:** IgE antibodies bind to mast cells, releasing histamine.
*   **Symptoms:** Sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose, difficulty breathing, skin rashes.
*   **Treatment:** Antihistamines, adrenaline, steroids.

---

## Drug & Alcohol Abuse

*   Use for non-medical purposes, causing harm.
*   **Commonly Abused Drugs:**
    *   **Opioids:** Morphine, heroin (sedative, painkiller).
    *   **Cannabinoids:** Marijuana, hashish (affect cardiovascular, hallucinations).
    *   **Cocaine:** Stimulant, euphoria, hallucinations.
    *   Barbiturates, Amphetamines, Benzodiazepines, LSD.

---

### Effects of Drug & Alcohol Abuse

*   **Short-term:** Reckless behavior, violence, impaired judgment.
*   **Long-term:** Liver cirrhosis, nervous system damage, addiction, increased infection risk (AIDS, hepatitis).
*   **Adolescent Abuse:** Poor academic performance, depression, aggression.

---

### Prevention and Control

*   Avoid undue peer pressure.
*   Education and counselling.
*   Seeking help from parents and peers.
*   Looking for danger signs.
*   Seeking professional and medical help (rehabilitation).
